<h1>Audacity Workbook<br />
</h1>
<div class="hyphenate">
<p>The Audacity program is an example of an 'audio editor'. This means that Audacity can record and edit audio. Typically, you use Audacity for recording sounds, like interviews or musical instruments. You can then use the program to combine these sounds and edit them to make documentaries, music, and podcasts.</p>
<h2>About this workbook<br />
</h2>
<p>This workbook is designed to help you learn about Audacity by providing you with information on how to complete specific tasks and background information on the software which can be used as hand outs. We also provide links to sample audio files to make it easier for learners to complete these tasks.<br />
</p>
<p>This workbook is not aiming to be a complete manual. There is a great online manual produced by the Audacity team online at <a href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/help/manual/" class="uri">http://manual.audacityteam.org/help/manual/</a></p>
<p>The workbook is structured into three sections; basic use, proficient use and advanced use. Each section gives you one or two tasks to complete to allow you to test yourself and show your understanding and ability to use the software. This structure makes it easy to use these resources as part of informal or assessed courses or workshops. <br />

<h1>Introduction to Audacity</h1>
<p>You may wish to learn to use Audacity if you would like to record or edit audio. Audacity is a very simple software and extremely useful for recording interviews, making podcasts, making sound collages, creating documentaries, recording songs etc.</p>
<p>Audacity is an example of a type of software known as an 'audio editor'. This means that Audacity can record and edit audio. Typically, you use Audacity for recording sounds, like interviews or musical instruments. You can then use the program to combine these sounds and edit them to make documentaries, music, and podcasts.</p>
<p>It is a relatively simple application compared to a lot of commercial audio editors. </p>
<p><span></span>In the past, audio editing was done with huge machines that recorded sound to tape (similar to the tape in tape cassettes).</p>
<p><img src="/audacity-workbook/_edit/static/Audacity-audacity_cover2c-en.gif" alt="audacity_cover2c.gif" width="350" height="225" /></p>
<p>Audio engineers would then edit these tapes using razor blades and sticky tape. Much of the jargon used in audio editing today comes from this process. Making a 'cut' meant literally cutting the audio tape at a certain point. 'Multitrack' referred to recording many separate sounds onto extra wide tape to fit more 'tracks'. The recording industry still uses these terms today. Many of the fundamental techniques which formed good audio recording and editing practices in the past, laid the foundation for recording and editing software  today. <br />
</p>
<p>While many of the terms and techniques remain the same today, computers replaced tape machines, and digital files succeeded tapes. Hence, you now record audio and edit with a computer using software such as Audacity. You then store these sounds in files on a computer. This makes the process faster and requires a lot less physical storage space.</p>
<p><img src="/audacity-workbook/_edit/static/Audacity-audacity-en.gif" alt="audacity.gif" width="350" height="225" /> <br />
</p>
<p>Audacity is a powerful tool for recording and editing audio on a home computer. It's a very sophisticated program and can do everything you would expect from a modern audio editor. Audacity perhaps falls short of meeting the needs of professional recording studios, but not by much.</p>
<p>You can install and run Audacity on <strong>Linux</strong>, <strong>Mac OS X</strong> and <strong>Windows</strong>. </p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>To show your understanding of this chapter and to check that Audacity is right for you, please write as a comment below, one or two sentences on how you use or want might use Audacity. If you have used Audacity please describe how you find it.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> &quot;I would use Audacity to combine recorded voices and music to create short radio jingles for a hospital radio I work for. I have never used Audacity but my collegues have and recommend it.&quot;</p>
<p><span id="ch004_open-import-a-file.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Open a Sound File</h1>
<p>Download the following audio file - <a href="http://soundcloud.com/mickradio/pancake-keith/download" class="uri">http://soundcloud.com/mickradio/pancake-keith/download</a></p>
<p><span>If you have any problems then ask for help in the comment section below. Otherwise mark this task as complete and move on to the next task.</span>Choose the 'Open' option from the <strong>File</strong> menu :</p>
<p><img src="static/Audacity-edit-open-en.jpg" alt="open.jpg" width="331" height="189" /></p>
<p>You will then be presented with a window where you can browse to the location of the audio file on your computer :</p>
<p><img src="static/Audacity-edit-filebrowser-en.jpg" alt="filebrowser.jpg" width="570" height="399" /></p>
<p>You can see in the above example there are a couple of audio files. I will click on one (06_ice_cake.mp3) :</p>
<p><img src="static/Audacity-edit-filebrowser2-en.jpg" alt="filebrowser2.jpg" width="570" height="399" /><br />
</p>
<p>If I now press OK the file will be imported into Audacity.</p>
<p><br />
<img src="static/Audacity-edit-import-en.jpg" alt="import.jpg" width="322" height="186" /></p>
<p>Now its worth noting that Audacity has its own way of storing audio files. These are known as 'Audacity project files'. So when audio is imported into Audacity it is stored in the Audacity format. You cannot then go and edit these files with another audio editor unless you first export the file to another format (for example, to MP3).</p>
<p>Once the import has finished you will see the audio file displayed in the Audacity window :</p>
<p><img src="static/Audacity-edit-audio-en.jpg" alt="audio.jpg" width="600" height="402" /><br />
</p>
<p><span id="ch005_using-the-transport-toolbar.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Listen to a File <br />
</h1>
<p>Audacity controls the playback of an audio file with buttons for Play, Pause, Stop and other functions. These buttons are located on the 'transport toolbar' and it looks something like this:</p>
<p><img src="static/control001.png" alt="The Play button" /></p>
<p>Each of the buttons can be clicked on with the mosue or you can also use keyboard shortcuts. Below is a description of what each button does and its keyboard shortcut, and at the very end is a short task for you to complete.</p>
<p><strong><img src="http:/manual.audacityteam.org/help/manual/m/images/9/90/play.png" /> Play Button</strong><br />
Clicking on this button starts the playback at normal speed. If an area of track is selected, only that selection will be played. Otherwise, playback begins wherever the selection cursor is. <br />
<em>Keyboard shortcut: Spacebar</em></p>
<p><a href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/File:Pause.png" class="image" title="The Pause button"><img src="http:/manual.audacityteam.org/help/manual/m/images/4/47/pause.png" alt="The Pause button" /></a> <strong>Pause Button</strong><br />
Temporarily pauses playing or recording without losing your place. Press Pause a second time to resume.<br />
<em>Keyboard shortcut: p</em></p>
<p><span><a href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/File:Stop.png" class="image" title="The Stop button"><img src="http:/manual.audacityteam.org/help/manual/m/images/f/f9/stop.png" alt="The Stop button" /></a> <strong>Stop Buton</strong></span><br />
Stops playing or recording immediately. You have to Stop before you can use the &quot;Skip&quot; buttons below and before you can edit any audio. By default, Space on the keyboard functions as a shortcut to Play <strong>or</strong> Stop. <br />
<em>Keyboard shortcut: Spacebar</em></p>
<p><span><a href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/File:Rewind.png" class="image" title="The Skip to Start button"><img src="http:/manual.audacityteam.org/help/manual/m/images/0/01/rewind.png" alt="The Skip to Start button" /></a> <strong>Skip to Start Button</strong></span><br />
Move the cursor to the beginning of the project. This is useful if you want to play everything, or record a new track starting from the beginning.<br />
<em>Keyboard shortcut: Home</em></p>
<p><span><a href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/File:FFwd.png" class="image" title="The Skip to End button"><img src="http:/manual.audacityteam.org/help/manual/m/images/0/07/ffwd.png" alt="The Skip to End button" /></a> <strong>Skip to End Button</strong></span><br />
Move the cursor to the end of the project.<br />
<em>Keyboard shortcut: End</em></p>
<p><span><a href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/File:Record.png" class="image" title="The Record button"><img src="http:/manual.audacityteam.org/help/manual/m/images/e/e8/record.png" alt="The Record button" /></a> <strong>Record Button</strong></span><br />
We won't use this button in this task but clicking this button starts recording. <br />
<em>Keyboard shortcut: r</em></p>
<hr />
<h1><strong>Task</strong></h1>
<p>Use the transport toolbar to ;</p>
<ul>
<li>play, pause and stop the file</li>
<li>skip to start and skip to end of the file</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="ch006_create-a-10-second-clip-from-your-file.xhtml"></span></p>
<p>Read the following, at the end is a task for you to complete. </p>
<p>You edit audio files in Audacity in much the same way as you would edit text in a word-processing document. When you are editing text you first select the text you want to change and then choose what you want to do with it. You might want to cut or copy the text, delete it, paste new text in it's place, or change it to bold. You can do the same kind of thing in Audacity with audio files.</p>
<p>Before you edit an audio file you will need to zoom in to the area you wish to edit.</p>
<p><a href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/File:Audacity-toolbar-edit-zoom-in-out.png" class="image" title="Image of edit toolbar with zoom controls highlighted"><img src="http:/manual.audacityteam.org/help/manual/m/images/6/60/audacity_toolbar_edit_zoom_in_out.png" alt="Image of edit toolbar with zoom controls highlighted" /></a></p>
<p>The image above shows the Edit Toolbar with the <em>Zoom buttons</em> highlighted. This <a href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/File:Tool_edit_zoomin.png" class="image" title="image of zoom in button"><img src="http:/manual.audacityteam.org/help/manual/m/images/e/e0/tool_edit_zoomin.png" alt="image of zoom in button" /></a> is the <em>Zoom In</em>tool, and this <a href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/File:Tool_edit_zoomout.png" class="image" title="image of zoom out button"><img src="http:/manual.audacityteam.org/help/manual/m/images/d/d3/tool_edit_zoomout.png" alt="image of zoom out button" /></a> is the <em>Zoom Out</em> tool.</p>
<p>Use the Zoom commands to see as much detail as you need, or to make sure you see the entire file when necessary.</p>
<h2><span>Selecting regions</span></h2>
<p>The easiest way to select a region of audio to edit is to use the 'select tool' and click and drag. First you choose the Selection tool <a href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/File:Tool_select.png" class="image" title="Selection tool"><img src="http:/manual.audacityteam.org/help/manual/m/images/2/25/tool_select.png" alt="Selection tool" /></a> from Tools Toolbar, below:</p>
<p><a href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/File:Tools_toolbar_basic7.png" class="image" title="Tools Toolbar"><img src="http:/manual.audacityteam.org/help/manual/m/images/4/4d/tools_toolbar_basic7.png" alt="Tools Toolbar" /></a></p>
<p>Now click the left mouse button anywhere inside of an audio track, and drag to the other edge of your selection, and release.</p>
<p><img src="static/Audacity-edit-select-en.jpg" alt="select.jpg" /></p>
<p>Some tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can drag from left to right or from right to left, it doesn't matter.</li>
<li>If you move the mouse past the left or right edge of the window while dragging, Audacity will scroll the window in that direction as long as the mouse button is down.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Trimming </h3>
<p>If you want to delete everything except for your selection this is called trimming, it is a type of editing. Make sure you have pressed <span>Space </span>to stop if the track is still playing then click on <span>Edit &gt; Remove Audio &gt; Trim</span>.</p>
<p>If you make a mistake, you can always click on <span>Edit &gt; Undo</span>. </p>
<h3>Cutting</h3>
<p>You can also cut and paste audio. You need to know select a small part of your audio file as described above. To delete the selection and copy it to your clipboard click on the <strong>Edit</strong> menu and choose 'cut' :</p>
<p><img src="static/Audacity-edit-cut-en.jpg" alt="cut.jpg" /></p>
<p>When you release the mouse button you will see that the selected area has disappeared and the length of your file will have been reduced.</p>
<h3>Pasting</h3>
<p>To paste the segment you have just cut click on the audio file at the point you where you want this audio to be pasted.</p>
<p><img src="static/Audacity-edit-insertpoint-en.jpg" alt="insertpoint.jpg" /></p>
<p>Choose the <strong>Edit</strong> menu and select <strong>Paste</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="static/Audacity-edit-paste-en.jpg" alt="paste.jpg" /></p>
<p>The audio will now be inserted and you if you look at the Audacity window you should see the selected audio in its new place :</p>
<p><img src="static/Audacity-edit-pasted-en.jpg" alt="pasted.jpg" /></p>
<hr />
<h1><strong>Task</strong></h1>
<ul>
<li>use the Zoom In and Zoom Out functions to get a closer look at the audio file</li>
<li>use the Select tools and the Trim function to choose one part of the file and get rid of the rest</li>
<li>select a small part of the file and paste it into another point in the file</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="ch007_exporting-a-file.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Saving and Exporting</h1>
<p>It is important to know the different between saving your Audacity project file and exporting a file from Audacity. This becomes important when you start to use more than one track of audio and use the more advanced features of editing.<br />
</p>
<h2>Saving Work as Audacity Projects<br />
</h2>
<p>Projects created in <strong>Audacity</strong> are always saved in Audacity's own unique file format that cannot be opened by most other software.</p>
<p>If you are working on a project with more than one track then when you have finished your project you should save it as an Audacity file <strong>.aup</strong>. Audacity can save all the tracks separately the small changes to volume levels and effects that you have made. In this way you can come back and work on your project again. This may be impossible to do if you save your work only as an audio file like an <strong>MP3</strong> or <strong>WAV</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="static/audacity2_export_12.png" /><br />
</p>
<p>If you want to archive your project onto portable media, an external hard drive for example then you should copy not only the <strong>.aup</strong> file that is created when you save it, but also the directory of the same name. Inside the _data directory is the raw audio data, so your project won't open properly if you don't copy that as well.</p>
<p>Because it is necessary to export projects to more common file formats in order to use them with other audio software or media players, Audacity will give you a warning when you start to save as <strong>.aup</strong> project files. </p>
<p><img src="static/audacity2_export_13.png" /> </p>
<h2>Exporting Projects as Audio Files<br />
</h2>
<p><strong>Audacity</strong> can export in a multitude of different formats these include: AIFF, MP3, WAV, FLAC and Ogg Vorbis.</p>
<p><strong>AIFF, WAV and FLAC</strong> files provide uncompressed CD quality audio so this format should be used if you want to open your Audacity project with other music production software or CD authoring software.</p>
<p><strong>MP3</strong> and <strong>Ogg Vorbis</strong> are both <span class="twikiNewLink">compressed<a href="http://old.flossmanuals.net/bin/edit/Audacity/Compressed?topicparent=Audacity.SavingAndExportingFiles" title="Create this topic">?</a></span> audio formats so they have lower sound quality but much smaller file sizes making them ideal for use in media players. The most important difference between these two formats is that <strong>Ogg Vorbis</strong> is completely open while <strong>MP3</strong> is not. For this reason you will need to download and install the LAME MP3 encoder before you can export in MP3 format.</p>
<p>To export a file from Audacity you need to have your an Audacity project open.<br />
</p>
<p>To export the file click <strong>'File'</strong> then click on 'Export'.</p>
<p><img src="static/audacity2_export_1_1.png" /> </p>
<p>You should now see the Export File window.</p>
<p><img src="static/audacity2_export_2.png" /> </p>
<p>This file browser gives you an option on where to save your files, what to call it (<strong>Name</strong>) and the file format you save it in.</p>
<p>You can choose from several popular audio file formats by clicking on the arrow next to the <strong>WAV (Microsofr) signed 16 bit PCM</strong> text. </p>
<p><img src="static/audacity2_export_3_1.png" /><br />
</p>
<p>If you choose the mp3 format, you may need to download and install the LAME MP3 encoder if you want to save as Mp3. See the separate information about that.</p>
<p>There may also be Options for the kind of file you have chosen. Click on the <strong><em>Options</em></strong> button to set them.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/audacity2_export_6.png" /></p>
<p><img src="static/audacity2_export_7.png" /><br />
</p>
<p>Once you are happy with the name, file format and folder then click on <em><strong>Save</strong></em>.</p>
<p>The next window you see should be <em><strong>Edit Metadata</strong></em>. <br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/audacity2_export_9.png" /><br />
</p>
<p>Use this window to edit the Metadata for the file you are creating. This will show up in mp3 and other hardware audio file players. Also it may be recognised by websites when uploading to the Internet. It's worth entering some information even if it's just the Artist and Track name.  When you are happy with the information click on the 'OK' button.</p>
<p>You may see see a window which asks says <strong><em>Warning: Your tracks will be mixed down to a single mono/ stereo track in the exported file</em></strong>. </p>
<p><img src="static/audacity2_export_10.png" /> </p>
<p>Mixing down our tracks into two stereo channels is exactly what we want here so click OK. If we think we'll want to come back to edit our multi track project then we should save that later as a <strong>.aup</strong> audacity file.<br />
</p>
<p>The time it takes to export the project will depend on the length of the recording and the speed of your computer. </p>
<p>When exporting is complete the above window will disappear. You should now be able to see the file in the folder that you chose to save it into.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/audacity2_export_11.png" /><br />
</p>
<p>That's it. You can now enjoy listening to the results of your Audacity project through other audio software, upload it to the Internet or transfer it on to your portable media player.</p>
<h2>Uploading Audio Files</h2>
<p>There are many sources of help on distributing audio files and podcasting which can be found by using a search engines.</p>
<p>However two popular websites stand out as being easy to use and a reliable home for your audio files; Sound Cloud [<a href="http://soundcloud.com">soundcloud.com</a>] and the Internet Archive [<a href="http://archive.org">archive.org</a>]. There is help on using the Internet Archive as a Floss manual [http://en.flossmanuals.net/archiveorg/index/].<span id="ch007_exporting-a-file.xhtml#InsertNoteID_10_marker11" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="exporting-a-file#InsertNoteID_10">1</a></sup></span> There is also good help on using Soundcloud on their website.<span id="ch007_exporting-a-file.xhtml#InsertNoteID_12_marker13" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="exporting-a-file#InsertNoteID_12">2</a></sup></span></p>

<br />
The forums contain a lot of postings from users on many topics. You can use the search system to locate topics or just browse the categories. If you don't find what you want then try subscribing to the forums and posting your question to the relevant category.</p>
<p>There are a few things to keep in mind when asking a question in a forum or to a mailing list. First, be as clear as you can with your question and provide any information that you might think would help some to try to help you. You might, for example, include information about the operating system you are using, or various specifics that relate to what you are trying to achieve. Additionally, it is always good practice to also post back to any forum or mailing list if you manage to solve your query and include clear information on how you solved the puzzle. This is so that someone else that may have the same issue can resolve it using what you have found out. If possible post back to the same thread (discussion topic) so that anyone searching through the forum can follow the discussion including the solution.</p>
<h2><span id="ch011_additional-help.xhtml#Mailing_Lists"></span> Mailing Lists</h2>
<p>Mailing lists are good places to look through for answers to questions. The subscription (also the archives are listed on each info page) information is located here :</p>
