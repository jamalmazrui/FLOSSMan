<h1>WordPress</h1>
<p><strong>WordPress</strong> was originally developed as blogging software: a <strong>blog</strong> (web-log) is an online journal, diary or commentary, presented as a website. Generally, one or more contributors (<strong>bloggers</strong>) add new content to the top of the website on a semi-regular basis. WordPress is now sophisticated enough to be used to create more advanced websites, and as such we should really call it a Content Management System (CMS). However, as it was not built for managing websites with large numbers of users, WordPress may sometimes require a bit of creativity to get it to do what you need. </p>
<p>WordPress has a reputation as being easy to use and flexible. It is particularly interesting for its enormous additional list of <strong>plugins.</strong> These are small additions to the software that add extra features. With plugins you can turn WordPress into a social networking site, add Testimonials, generate visitor statistics, and much much more.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/wordpress_600_badges.jpg" /><br />
</p>
<p>There are two basic ways in which you can start using WordPress:</p>
<ol>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Sign up for an account on <a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a> or a similar site that offers free blog hosting.<br />
</li>
<li>Install your own WordPress CMS on a server that you have access to.<br />
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
</ol>
<p>The first option is the easiest, but if you wish to have more control over how WordPress is configured and be able to add more functionality, then you will want the second option of installing WordPress yourself. In this case, you should download the software from <a href="http://wordpress.org" title="WordPress">WordPress.org</a>.<br />
</p>
<h2>What is the difference between WordPress.com and WordPress.org?</h2>
<p>The difference between WordPress.com and WordPress.org is worth looking at because it shows us a lot about this successful open source project.</p>
<p><strong><em>WordPress</em><em>.org</em></strong> is home to the blogging software WordPress. Here you can download the software and get support on installing, troubleshooting and using the software. Huge numbers of people write code voluntarily to make the software work better. This is possible because the software has an open licence which allows anyone to download it, use it and improve it. There is more information about the WordPress software on the About page of WordPress.org.<span id="ch001_introduction.xhtml#InsertNoteID_8_marker9" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="introduction#InsertNoteID_8">1</a></sup></span> Over 25 million independently-hosted blogs use this software. </p>
<p><strong><em>WordPress</em><em>.com is</em></strong> run by Automattic, a company that uses and adapts the WordPress software to provide a  service for bloggers. In this way, you can use WordPress without having to know how to install software on a server. It's free to sign up and use the basic service, but you pay extra to host videos, modify the layout (by editing the CSS), and to add other premium services. This commercial venture funds coders to spend time developing the core of WordPress code which benefits the wider community. There is more information about Automattic and Wordpress.com on their About page.<span id="ch001_introduction.xhtml#InsertNoteID_6_marker7" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="introduction#InsertNoteID_6">2</a></sup></span> Over 20 million blogs are hosted on Wordpress.com.<br />
</p>
<h3>Privacy limitations of WordPress.com</h3>
<p>WordPress.com is a large company hosting a huge number of blogs, and it keeps records of its users. It is also a US company and it complies to US law when it comes to disclosing users' details. Their privacy policy for international cases is less clear.<br />
</p>
<p>For the most part, WordPress.com seems to host controversial content without problem. However, there have been several cases where Automattic has come under criticism for releasing information about its users and for suspending blogs. If this is something that concerns you, then you should try to set up your own blog or use a WordPress service other than Wordpress.com.</p>
<h2>WordPress for Blogs and Websites</h2>
<p>WordPress started out as blogging software but it is now being used for much more. This chapter deals with what is a blog and then compares <em><strong>Blogs</strong></em> to <strong><em>Websites</em></strong>. There is another chapter which looks at WordPress and online communities.<br />
</p>
<h3>What is a Blog?<br />
</h3>
<p>A blog is a shortened version of the term &quot;we<strong>b</strong>-<strong>log&quot;</strong>.  A &quot;log&quot; is a written record, such as a diary, and a &quot;web-log&quot; is a diary that is kept on the web. The first blogs were very much like diaries, or personal accounts of peoples' lives. However blogs are now used for a wide range of activities. Blogs are used by independent journalists for publishing and they are used by companies for reporting on internal activities. Web businesses use them to inform their users about what they are doing, or they are used as a kind of online magazine. There are many, many other uses for blogs.</p>
<h3>Websites compared to Blogs</h3>
<p>Websites are often slower to change compared to blogs, and have more static information. Structurally they have more of a focus on menus and sub-sections, allowing visitors to navigate to the part of the website that contains the information they need, whereas blogs often display a list of posts on a single page with the most recent entry at the top. Websites are often maintained by more than one person, so different levels of user access can be useful.</p>
<p>Websites are becoming more like blogs because of the need for easy integration with social networking software. At the same time, blogging software is becoming more suitable for creating websites. For WordPress this is especially true due to more advanced use of menus, different user roles, community focus and the intuitive user interface that it offers.<br />
</p>
<p>If you are considering spending a lot of time and potentially money (if you are paying others) on a website with other tools it is definitely worth asking the question: &quot;Can we quickly create a site that fulfills our needs with WordPress?&quot; If the answer is yes, keep reading this manual!     <br />

<p><span id="ch002_wordpress-for-communities.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>WordPress and Communities</h1>
<p>WordPress is a good entry point into the many possible online communities. It is easy to use and it comes from a history of blogging. Bloggers were pioneers in increasing the interaction between writers on the internet. In this chapter we look at some of the things that online communities need to thrive and how you can use WordPress to achieve them.</p>
<p><img src="static/andrea-prieto_communities_500_1.jpg" /><br />
 </p>
<h2>Low barriers to entry<br />
</h2>
<p>Members of a community need to be comfortable with the tools they are using. They also need to be able to share knowledge about how these tools work. WordPress offers this in a number of different ways.</p>
<h3>Free WordPress sites are great for testing and evaluation<br />
</h3>
<p>Unlike some other Content Management Systems (CMS) which require you to set them up on a server, you can sign up for a WordPress blog in many places for free - wordpress.com being the most popular - and it only takes a couple of minutes. This allows you to try WordPress out to see if it works for you. There is an easy to use export and import functionality for content, so you can always migrate to your own site later if you wish.<br />
</p>
<h3>Intuitive and standard user interface<br />
</h3>
<p>WordPress has an accessible user interface; the forms and tips are fairly intuitive and it certainly compares very favorably with other similar open source tools. There are more 'advanced' community website systems out there which offer more flexibility, however they bring the disadvantage that they are configured in different ways. Having a standard makes it easier to write and provide documentation for WordPress users.</p>
<h3>Tools to build community and interaction</h3>
<p>WordPress draws on the traditions of bloggers and indeed the very beginnings of the web. By default, WordPress includes comments, pingbacks, blog lists, and links to other related sites. It is also very easy for you to &quot;cross-post&quot; to services like Twitter and Status.net. This means that a post you write can be automatically posted to other communities.<br />
</p>
<h2>Staying independent and in control<br />
</h2>
<p>While centralised network services have become dominant, there have always been alternatives. WordPress offers many of the advantages of social media, without the disadvantages of the 'walled-gardens' of centralised services. </p>
<p>Although WordPress in built on free software, the installation of it at WordPress.com can be seen as a centralized network service. The &quot;Open Web&quot; is built on a decentralized approach to hosting and as such has inbuilt resilience to censorship. Reliance on huge network services as the arbiters of free speech is a very weak position. Such services come under daily pressures from authorities for disclosure. As such, they often opt for an easy life by handing over personal details and suspending accounts, websites and blogs with little in the way of an appeal process.</p>
<p>By setting up your own WordPress installation and publishing your content there, you have a big advantage over using a hosted service: you remove the risk involved when relying on a network service that is out of your hands. A community made up of people sharing their content from independent nodes is extremely robust.</p>
<h2>Why create a WordPress Network<br />
</h2>
<p>A <strong>WordPress Network</strong> is a way of setting up your WordPress installation so that many different blogs can be hosted on it. The website at wordpress.com is one example. Rather than setting up many different sites and maintaining them separately, creating a WordPress Network allows the creation of hundreds of sites with only one set of code to keep up to date.<br />
</p>
<p>With only limited webhosting skills, you can offer independently hosted blogs to members of your community. Let's look at how and why you might want to set up network and explore some tools and tactics to help foster communities. </p>
<p><img src="/wordpress/_edit/static/wordpress_smswigart_600.jpg" /><br />
</p>
<p>Whether your community is sharing technical discussions, community matters, or political opinions, every community benefits from independence and robustness. A community that is in control of their means of content production is a good thing. </p>
<p>Even if you are managing a small network of, for example, 20 church websites, if you choose to run it as a WordPress network instead of using WordPress.com then you are helping the resilience of the Open Web. If you run this network well, its users will be able to interact without using more centralized services like Facebook. </p>
<p>Part of this chapter is adapted from a chapter in a book about the Open Web, which goes into more depth on these issues: <a href="http://new.flossmanuals.net/an-open-web/">http://en.flossmanuals.net/an-open-web/</a></p>
<h3>Technical considerations of running a network</h3>
<p>WordPress is free software: you can download it and install it on your own server. As such, you are not bound by the take-down and privacy policies of WordPress.com. If you have website creation skills, it is relatively easy to install a WordPress network. This allows you to host many blogs, install extra functionality for them and makes it easy to keep the software updated. WordPress blogs are a great entry point into the social media maze as they have RSS feeds, publicly vetted APIs<span id="ch002_wordpress-for-communities.xhtml#InsertNoteID_7_marker8" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="wordpress-for-communities#InsertNoteID_7">1</a></sup></span>  and useful plugins to allow cross posting. With the BuddyPress functionality you can also create a very usable social network.<br />
</p>
<p>You can anonymize blogs and services by not logging IP addresses. The process of not logging IP addresses on a server using Apache is relatively simple - you can use the removeip Apache module. Rather than trying to remove all logs of IP addresses, it replaces them with an arbitrary IP number.</p>
<h3>Avoid the cloud</h3>
<p>Hosting your blogs or networks in the &quot;cloud&quot; may offer technical advantages, but it may come at the cost of reducing your control over your resources.<span id="ch002_wordpress-for-communities.xhtml#InsertNoteID_10_marker11" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="wordpress-for-communities#InsertNoteID_10">2</a></sup></span>  Not all cloud computing is bad; many independent hosting companies are taking advantage of the open source Open Stack approach to cloud computing.<span id="ch002_wordpress-for-communities.xhtml#InsertNoteID_6_marker7" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="wordpress-for-communities#InsertNoteID_6">3</a></sup></span><br />
</p>
<p>If possible, choose a smaller provider who can offer more support and options. If they receive a take-down order, they may be able to discuss this with you to help develop a joint approach to the problem and may help you fight your corner.</p>
<h3>Be responsible</h3>
<p>Don't over-reach yourself. If you are an individual or a small group setting up a network to help people escape from services like Facebook, try out a limited service first with a small number of essential plugins and well-tested themes. You can always add more later, when users request them.</p>
<p>Work with others as much as possible. If you alone set up a network of hundreds of sites, even if you have the best will in the world, it is a very weak position. You may lose interest, get a full time job, go a bit mad or have new personal commitments that mean you are unable to maintain the network. If you are part of a team then others can share the workload as well as bring their specific skills to the project.</p>
<h3>Create your own Acceptable Usage Policy<br />
</h3>
<p>Take time as a group to make sure you are agreed on what/who you are prepared to host or not. Then make this agreement public as your AUP (Acceptable Usage Policy). You may want to support free speech but that does not mean that you have to support everyone. The internet is a big place and they will find a home somewhere else.   </p>
<p>Create a clear (and perhaps automated) process for applying for a website or blog where people have to agree to these terms. You should also develop a clear and fair way of taking down websites that you no longer feel you can support, and suggest alternative hosting options for users you have to disconnect</p>
<h3>Create good help resources</h3>
<p>You should to try to ensure that when your users have signed up for their site that they get a welcome message which directs them towards a place where they can get help on using the site. You can create a help page on your network which sign-posts people to existing help, and add other help that is specific to the set up of your network. This can point people towards forums and email lists where their questions may have already been answered. </p>
<p>There is a lot of good help that you can link to that is already out there and much that is written in an open license which means that you can adapt it for your site. There are also video tutorials that help people who best learn in this way. Seek them out and put them on the support pages of your network.<br />
</p>
<p>For an example of a help page for a network you can see one here: <a href="https://network23.org/help-and-faq" class="uri">https://network23.org/help-and-faq</a></p>
<h3>Encourage interaction between network sites</h3>
<p>One of things about social networking that makes it hard to beat is the immediate response from a community that users can quickly build up. In Facebook they work hard to make it easy to make links with people, share information with them and comment on each others' content. This is something that is not as intuitive in a WordPress network, but there are things that can be done.</p>
<p><strong>BuddyPress</strong> is a plugin which is specifically set up to try to achieve this aim; it alters the front page of your network site to show recently posted content and a list of users. You can also enable the use of <strong>site-wide tags</strong> which create pages listing content tagged with the same term across the whole network of users.<span id="ch002_wordpress-for-communities.xhtml#InsertNoteID_12_marker13" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="wordpress-for-communities#InsertNoteID_12">4</a></sup></span>  See later chapters on how to set up and use BuddyPress and site-wide tags. </p>

</ol>
<p><span id="ch004_logging-in.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Logging In<br />
</h1>
<p>The first thing you need to log in is a <em>username</em> and <em>password</em>. If you have set up your own WordPress site then you should have them. If someone else set up the site, they may have notified you in an automatically generated email from WordPress with the title &quot;Your Username and Password&quot;. If you are setting up your site on a server yourself then progress to the Installing on a Server section.<br />
</p>
<p>There are several ways to find the log-in page to your WordPress site. If the site has recently been created with a default theme, there is a <strong>Meta</strong> section on the side of the page. Find the <strong>Meta</strong> section in the sidebar and then click the <strong>Log in</strong> link.</p>
<p><img src="static/basic_login_6.png" width="170" height="207" /> </p>
<p>On the next screen, enter your <em>username</em> and <em>password</em> and click <strong>Log In</strong>. If you have forgotten your password then you can get a reminder by clicking on <strong>Lost your Password?</strong><br />
</p>
<div>
<img src="static/basic_login_3.png" width="450" height="563" />
</div>
<p> </p>
<h3>Troubleshooting<br />
</h3>
<p>Sometimes, as in the following example, if the site's theme has been modified there may be no link to the log-in page. But all is not lost, read on ...<br />
</p>
<p>To get to the log in screen, go to the home address of the site. In this case: <em><strong>http://network23.org/photo</strong></em><br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/basic_login_2.png" width="600" height="181" /></p>
<p>Now add <strong><em>/wp-admin</em></strong> to the address bar of the browser and press Enter / Return or click on the green Go button on the address bar.</p>
<p><img src="static/basic_login_7.png" /> </p>
<p>If you are not logged in this will bump you to the log-in screen where you can enter your username and password then click the <strong>Log In</strong> button.<br />
</p>
<div>
<img src="static/basic_login_4.png" /> 
</div>
<p>You should then see your <strong>Dashboard</strong>. There is more information on how to use the <strong>Dashboard</strong> in another chapter.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span id="ch005_introduction-to-the-dashboard.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Using the Dashboard and Settings<br />
</h1>
<p>When you have logged into your site, you should see what is called your <strong>Dashboard</strong>. This is the control panel where you can add new content to your blog, manage users and change settings.</p>
<p><img src="static/dashboard_2.png" width="600" height="315" /><br />
</p>
<p>You can think of the Dashboard as the back-end of your blog, compared to the front-end which is what your readers see. The key to using WordPress is to understand your Dashboard.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Why not try opening a new tab in your Internet browser so you can see both the front-end (your publicly visible blog) and your Dashboard at the same time. This will make it easier when you are working on your blog to see the changes. When you have done this, click on the new tab to see the front-end of your blog. It will be available at the URL in the address bar of your browser. </p>
<h2>The Side Menu of the Dashboard<br />
</h2>
<p>Just about everything you need to do can be accessed through the side menu of the Dashboard.</p>
<p><img src="static/dashboard_3.png" /><br />
</p>
<p>It is divided in two two sections. The first includes <strong>Posts, Media, Links, Pages</strong> and <strong>Comments</strong>. This section is for adding and managing the content of your site.</p>
<p>The second section lists <strong>Appearance, Plugins, Users, Tools</strong> and <strong>Settings</strong>. This is where you can alter the appearance and functionality of your site.<br />
</p>
<p>Clicking on any of these sections give you a page of key options and additional subsections. For example, clicking on <strong>Appearance</strong> takes you to a page where you can choose a new theme and also shows links to the options <strong>Widgets, Menus, Background</strong> and <strong>Header</strong>.<br />
</p>
<h2>Introduction to WordPress Settings<br />
</h2>
<p>There are some settings that are important to check before you start using your site. Navigate to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>General</strong> and check that the settings there are correct.</p>
<p><img src="static/dashboard_11.png" width="223" height="245" /> </p>
<p>Here you can change the name of your site which appears on all of your pages.</p>
<p><img src="static/dashboard_5.png" width="600" height="465" /><br />
</p>
<p>The default <strong>Tagline</strong> is often something like &quot;Just another WordPress site&quot;, which makes your site look at bit unloved, so it is a good idea to put something more descriptive.<br />
</p>
<p>Do check that the time settings are what you want them to be, as the time is shown on posts. When you are happy with the settings click on <strong>Save Changes</strong>.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/save_changes.png" /></p>
<h3>Writing Settings</h3>
<p>From the Dashboard, go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Writing Settings</strong>. Here you can change the settings for how many posts appear on each page, and what the default category for each post is.</p>
<p><img src="static/dashboard_7.png" width="600" height="230" /><br />
</p>
<p>There is a section on the <strong>Writing Settings</strong> page about <strong>Remote Publishing</strong>. This may be useful if you want to publish to WordPress from your phone, iPad or other similar platforms or tools. Make sure to tick these options if you want to publish in this way.</p>
<p><img src="static/dashboard_9.png" width="600" height="192" /><br />
</p>
<p>When you are happy with the <strong>Writing Settings</strong> click on <strong>Save Changes</strong>.</p>
<h3>Reading Settings<br />
</h3>
<p>Next, it is good to check your <strong>Reading Settings</strong>. Here you have options to change what is displayed on your site's front page, including how many posts to show on each page and to include in your RSS feeds.   <img src="static/dashboard_10.png" width="600" height="490" /></p>
<p>If you are using your WordPress install mostly as a static website containing information that doesn't change much, you may want to point visitors to an About page when they first visit your WordPress site. </p>
<p><img src="static/dashboard_12.png" width="510" height="168" /><br />
</p>
<p>You'll get to learn more about other areas of the <strong>Dashboard</strong> and <strong>Settings</strong> in the other chapters of this manual. </p>
<p><span id="ch007_add-a-post.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Adding and Editing Posts</h1>
<p>One of the first things to do when starting up a blog is to learn how to add a post. There is a section later in the chapter showing you how to edit a post you have created earlier.<br />
</p>
<p>Once you have logged in, you should be on a page called the Dashboard (explained in the previous chapter). On the left there is menu which includes <strong>Posts</strong>.<br />
<br />
<img src="static/basic_addpost_2.png" /> <br />
</p>
<p>Click on this link and the Posts page should appear. This shows a list of the post that have already been made.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/basic_addpost_3.png" width="600" height="255" /> <br />
</p>
<p>To get started, click on <strong>Add New</strong>. You can click on the button shown below or on the text in the lefthand menu.<br />
<img src="static/basic_addpost_4.png" /> </p>
<p>If you have already created a post and want to come back to it to make changes then you can hover over the post you want to edit and then click on the <strong>Edit</strong> link when it appears:</p>
<p><img src="static/edit_post_1.png" width="600" height="196" /><br />
</p>
<p>Enter a title for your new post and some text which is the main body of the post. Think of this as similar to writing an email - it really is as easy at that. The title is important, as it will act as a link to your post in some cases, so don't forget to fill that out. </p>
<p><img src="static/basic_addpost_5.png" width="600" height="361" /></p>
<p>Click in the large blank space and type (or paste) the text content of your post. This space for text functions in the same way as a word processor: there are icons above the space which allow you to format the text. This called a WYSIWYG editor, which stands for &quot;What You See Is What You Get<strong>&quot;</strong>. In the example below we are highlighting some text and making it <strong>bold</strong>.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/basic_addpost_6.png" width="450" height="219" /> </p>
<p>When you have finished writing your post, you can click <strong>Preview</strong> to see how the post will appear to readers of your blog; the preview will normally open in another browser tab, so that you can easily switch back to the edit screen to make any changes.</p>
<p>When you are satisfied that your post is finished, click <strong>Publish</strong>. Your post will now appear on your web site for site visitors to read.</p>
<p>If your post isn't finished and you want to come back to it later, click <strong>Save Draft</strong> to save it without publishing it. You can then find it in the list of posts on the Posts page, and click <strong>Edit</strong> to continue working on it.</p>
<p> <img src="static/basic_addpost_publish_button.png" /><br />
</p>
<p>If you want to see what your post looks like, click on the <strong>View Post</strong> link that appears above what you have written.</p>
<p><img src="static/basic_addpost_view_post.png" /><br />
</p>
<p>On clicking this link you will be taken to the web page which features your post. You can see the formatting changes that you have made.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/basic_addpost_8_1.png" width="600" height="319" /></p>
<p>This is the core information you need to know to add a new post. We can do a lot more if we learn how to format using the WYSIWYG editor.</p>
<h2>Using the WYSIWYG editor</h2>
<p>We can use the WYSIWYG editor to make lots of formatting changes to the post. If you want to add images and other documents to the post, this is covered in other chapters.</p>
<p>You will notice that at the top righthand corner of the text input area are two tabs: &quot;Visual&quot; and &quot;HTML&quot;. You need to be on the &quot;Visual&quot; tab in order to use the WYSIWYG editor. The HTML tab will show you the HTML code as well as the text content of your post, and no formatting icons. </p>
<h3>Adding links to other internet pages</h3>
<p><img src="static/basic_addpost_editor_1.png" width="43" height="40" />We can add a link to another page on the internet by highlighting the text that we want to make into a link and then clicking on the icon with chain links on it:</p>
<p><img src="static/basic_addpost_editor_2.png" width="600" height="201" /></p>
<p>A dialogue box appears; enter the web address (URL) of the web page you want to link to. You need to include the <strong>http://</strong> at the beginning of the address:<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/basic_addpost_editor_3.png" width="575" height="267" /><br />
</p>
<p>Then click <strong>Add Link</strong>. Your link should now be in your editor's window and show up as a blue colour. When you have <strong>Published</strong> or <strong>Updated</strong> your post, you will see that when you hover over the link, the title of the link shows up in an information box.</p>
<p><img src="static/basic_addpost_editor_4.png" width="279" height="99" /></p>
<h3>Adding Bullet Point Lists</h3>
<p><img src="static/basic_addpost_9.png" width="34" height="33" />You can make bullet points by selecting text and click on the icon to add a bullet point list:<br />
 <br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/basic_addpost_7.png" width="596" height="374" /><br />
</p>
<h3>Using the 'Kitchen Sink' icon</h3>
<p>If you are looking at these screenshots and thinking that there are more icons shown there than you can see, then you need to know about the &quot;Kitchen Sink&quot; icon:<br />
<img src="static/basic_addpost_editor_5.png" /></p>
<p>Clicking on this icon either hides or shows a second row of icons which give extra options for formatting your text. These functions include adding different headings, underline, adding colours to text, indenting and more. </p>
<h3>Adding headings to WordPress posts</h3>
<p>Text headings can be very useful to divide up your writing into different sections, making it more readable on the screen. Headings are also useful as they are read by search engines and therefore make your content more findable.</p>
<p>WordPress allows you to select from Heading 1 to Heading 6, with Heading 1 being the largest font size. Normally you will only need to use Headings 1 to 3. If you think you need more than that, you might want to consider restructuring your writing.<br />
</p>
<p>Select the text that you want to make into a heading. Then click on the Paragraph drop down menu (if you can't see that then first click on the Kitchen Sink icon - see above).</p>
<p><img src="static/add_post_end_2.png" /></p>
<p>Select the size of heading that you want to apply to your text:<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/add_post_end_1.png" width="498" height="208" /></p>
<p>You should see a change in the size of the text you highlighted:</p>
<p><img src="static/add_post_end_3.png" width="544" height="148" /><br />
</p>
<h3>Indenting text</h3>
<p>You can indent text when you are formatting a post in WordPress; this is often used when quoting another source. The example below shows a quote which we want to make more distinct from the rest of the text. First we highlight the text that we want to indent:<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/add_post_end_4.png" width="541" height="223" /><br />
</p>
<p>Click on the <strong>Indent</strong> button. This is the righthand button of the two similar looking buttons which feature lines and an arrow. The arrow indicates if the text is to be indented (pointing to the right) or outdented (pointing to the left).</p>
<p><img src="static/add_post_end_5.png" /></p>
<p>When you have pressed the <em><strong></strong></em> <strong>Indent</strong> button the text should move to add more space on the left as shown below: </p>
<p><img src="static/add_post_end_6.png" width="543" height="188" /> </p>
<p><br />
</p>

<h1>Adding images to posts</h1>
<p>There are several ways of adding images to posts. The two most common are uploading an image file from your computer or linking to an image that is already on the internet by finding its web address (URL).</p>
<p>The advantage of linking directly to an image that is already on the internet is that you don't have to spend time uploading it to your site. The disadvantage that the image you link to may disappear. To be safe, take a moment longer to download the image and upload it your own blog.</p>
<p>If you are using your own installation of WordPress, you may have to make changes to your <strong>Upload Settings</strong> in the <strong>Settings</strong> part of your Dashboard before you are able to upload images. There is help on that aspect elsewhere in this manual.<br />
</p>
<p>When you are in the editing interface for your post, place the cursor where you want your image to appear. This is usually easier if you write the text first. </p>
<p><img src="static/add_image_a1.png" width="563" height="258" /><br />
</p>
<p>Then click on the <img src="static/add_image_a3.png" width="142" height="29" /> icon, which is the button to <strong>Add Media</strong>.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/add_image_a2.png" width="299" height="155" /> <br />
 </p>
<p>A dialogue box will appear. This gives you a choice of several ways to add your image</p>
<h2>Uploading images from your computer</h2>
<p><img src="static/add_image_a4.png" width="600" height="374" /><br />
</p>
<p>You can then drag and drop files from your computer's file browser into the big space shown in this window. <br />
</p>
<p>Or, there is also an option to use 'browser uploader' which will give you the following dialogue box. <br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/add_images_4.png" width="450" height="256" /> </p>
<h3><br />
</h3>
<p>If you want to upload an image from your computer then click <strong>Browse.</strong></p>
<p>You will be presented with a File Upload or similar dialogue box that allows you to navigate to the image on your computer; this will look different depending on the type of operating system you have. When you find the file you want to upload, select it and click <strong>Open</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="static/add_images_5.png" width="450" height="163" /><br />
</p>
<p>This will bring you back to the <strong>Add Media</strong> screen. You should see the path and the filename of the image you selected in the box. Now click on the <strong>Upload</strong> button to the right of this.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/add_images_7.png" width="450" height="160" /><br />
</p>
<h3>Configuring your uploaded Image<br />
</h3>
<p>After your file/s has uploaded, you should see a thumbnail of the image followed by options about how to display it in your post. </p>
<p><img src="static/add_images_8.png" width="600" height="510" /> </p>
<p>For this image I want to align the image to the left so that the text I've written wraps around it. I also want to select a <strong>Medium</strong> version of the image as the <strong>Full Size</strong> one would be too big to fit on the page.<br />
</p>
<p>I don't need a caption or description at the moment (if I change my mind, I can always return later and add that information).<br />
</p>
<p>When you have filled in as many details as you need to, click <strong>Insert into Post</strong> at the bottom of the options.<br />
</p>
<p>You should now see you image in your post about the right place you wanted it, or at least where you had the cursor flashing when you started the process.</p>
<p><img src="static/add_images_9.png" width="600" height="242" /><br />
</p>
<h2>Making changes to an image</h2>
<p>If you want to adjust the size of the image on your screen, or change the spacing around the image, then you need to edit the image.</p>
<h3>Changing image spacing<br />
</h3>
<p>To change the spacing you need to alter the <strong>Advanced Settings</strong> of the image. First, click on the image in your post. Remember we are still in the edit mode; if you have published your post and are looking at the final result you'll need to go back to the editing interface.</p>
<p>When you click on the image, you'll see two icons appear in the top left of the image: </p>
<p><img src="static/add_images_10.png" width="450" height="232" /><br />
</p>
<p>The first icon shows a landscape; this allows you to change the settings of the image. The second is a red circle which is to delete the image if you no longer want it to appear in your post.</p>
<p>Click on the landscape icon. You'll see a dialogue box similar to when you first inserted in the image into the post. Click on the tab which says <strong>Advanced Settings</strong>. </p>
<p>  <img src="static/add_images_11.png" width="600" height="506" /><br />
</p>
<p>To create a bit of spacing around the image, enter numbers in to the boxes. <strong>Vertical space</strong> creates a margin on the top and bottom of the image, and <strong>Horizontal space</strong> creates space to the left and right of the image.</p>
<p>Enter a number in the box of your choice. Something around 10 pixels creates a good margin. Then click <strong>Update</strong> at the bottom of the window.<br />
</p>
<p>Preview your post to check the result before you publish or update the post; the margin around the image may be bigger or smaller than you want. Just go back to the Advanced Settings to adjust it.<br />
</p>
<h3>Changing the size of an Image</h3>
<p>There are a few different ways to change the size of an image. When you upload you are normally given four general options: thumbnail, medium, large and full size. </p>
<p>Another way to change the size and alignment of an image is in the <strong>Advanced Settings</strong>. Navigate to the <strong>Advanced Setting</strong> screen as shown above.</p>
<p>You will see the image size as you inserted it in the <strong>Size</strong> row. In this case it is <strong>Width 300</strong> and <strong>Height 225</strong>. The numbers refer to pixels. A normal width for your posts in WordPress is about 600.<br />
</p>
<p>You are able to set a smaller size by clicking on the 90%, 80%, 70% and 60% numbers to the left of your image. </p>
<p><img src="static/add_images_12.png" width="600" height="370" /><br />
</p>
<p>In the example above, 60% is selected and you can see that the Width and Height figures have gone down. You can also put in your own numbers into the Width and Height boxes.</p>
<p>When you have found a size you like, click <strong>Update</strong> at the bottom of the window, and then either <strong>Publish</strong> or <strong>Update</strong> your post.</p>
<p>In this example you may have noticed that once we had inserted the image as a medium sized image, in this case 300 pixels wide, that we couldn't increase its size even though the original had been 1024 pixels wide.</p>
<p>We could upload the image again and insert it as full size, but we could also do it another way if we learn how to use the Media Library.<br />
</p>
<h2>Using the Media Library</h2>
<p>To continue with the example above, let's re-insert our original image as a full size image. We can select the image in our post and delete it. Click on the image and then Click the red icon to delete it.</p>
<p><img src="static/add_images_13.png" width="300" height="218" /><br />
</p>
<p>Although the image is no longer visible in the post, it is still in your WordPress system somewhere behind the scenes. To insert it again, we need to find it in the <strong>Media Library</strong>.</p>
<p>To access the Media Library, follow the same procedure as above when you are adding an image for the first time. However after you click <strong>Add an Image</strong> icon, select the tab <strong>Media Library</strong> in the <strong>Add an Image</strong> window.</p>
<p><img src="static/add_images_14.png" width="600" height="340" /></p>
<p>This shows you all the images that have been uploaded to your WordPress site. If you have uploaded more than 10 then you may need to click on the numbers on the top right to move to the next pages of images to find the one you have looking for. You can also use the Search function, if you know the name of the file.</p>
<p>In this case the image we want is right at the top. To re-insert it at its original size, click the <strong>Show</strong> link to the right of the relevant image. </p>
<p><img src="static/add_images_15.png" width="601" height="156" /></p>
<p> This will open up a familiar looking window which will allow you to change the settings for the image. In the screenshot below, the image is full size and aligned to the centre. There is also a description of the image and a caption.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/add_images_16.png" width="600" height="511" /></p>
<p>After clicking <strong>Insert into Post</strong>, you may want to alter the size of the image in the post to be something around or less thatn 600 pixels. This will depend on the theme your site is using, but most themes have a post width that is 600 or less.</p>
<p>You can alter the size in one of the ways described above or there is another way. In the edit view you can click on the corner of the image and drag it to the appropriate size. This will also preserve the shape of the image.</p>
<p><img src="static/add_images_17.png" width="600" height="326" /><br />
</p>
<p>When clicking the mouse, hold it down and start to move the pointer. You'll see a grey window which tells you dimensions of the new image size. You can release the mouse button when you are happy with the size of the image.</p>
<p>Don't forget to click on the Update button on the right to save your changes.<br />
<img src="static/update_button_.png" /><br />

<h1>Using Categories and Tags</h1>
<p>Categories and Tags are two ways to help visitors to your site find the content they want. They are very similar in the way they work. The main difference is that normally categories are set up in a planned and limited way, whereas tags can be added spontaneously and there is no need to limit the number of tags that can be used. </p>
<p>There are several advantages to using categories and tags. For example, when visitors first view your site they can easily see the subject matter of your posts and decide if your site is of general interest to them. </p>
<p>Readers can also navigate to pages which list only posts of a specific tag or category by clicking on the name of the category or tag. This is useful if you want to create menus for your site based on this kind of taxonomy; for more information about how to do this, see the chapter on Menus.<br />
</p>
<h2>Examples of Categories and Tags</h2>
<p>Categories and tags are often shown as widgets in the side column of a site:</p>
<p><img src="static/tags_3.png" width="238" height="412" /><br />
</p>
<p>Tags are often shown in a &quot;cloud&quot; where the size of the text indicates the popularity of each tag.</p>
<p><img src="static/categories_2.png" width="371" height="307" /></p>
<p>Categories are normally shown as a simple list displayed in alphabetical order. </p>
<p>Clicking on any of the tags or categories will normally take you to a page which has a summary list of the posts. The URL (web address) of the page will include the name of your category.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/categories_5.png" width="600" height="399" /><br />
</p>
<h2>Adding tags to posts and pages</h2>
<p>To add tags to posts and pages, you simply enter them in the tags box in the righthand column of the <strong>Add Post</strong> page. </p>
<p><img src="static/tags_1.png" width="351" height="172" /></p>
<p>When you click <strong>Add</strong>, the tag(s) will appear beneath the text box. You can delete them by clicking on on the X, or add more.</p>
<p><img src="static/tags_2.png" width="350" height="190" /></p>
<p>To display tags on your site, add the Tag Cloud widget to your sidebar. There is more help on adding widgets in the chapter Using Widgets.<br />
</p>
<h2>Setting and adding categories</h2>
<p>When you first create your site, you will normally have one catch-all category set up for you called 'Uncategorized'. This will be visible on the page in your Dashboard where you add posts. </p>
<p><img src="static/categories_3.png" width="349" height="397" /><br />
</p>
<p>Leaving this unchanged can make your site look very sad. So it is a good idea to add some new categories. Click <strong>Add New Category</strong> to do this.</p>
<p><img src="static/categories_4.png" width="352" height="187" /> </p>
<p>Enter the name of your new category and then click on <strong>Add New Category</strong> to add it. Repeat this until you have included the categories that you think you will need for your site. You can always add more later if necessary.</p>
<p><img src="static/categories_1.png" width="352" height="403" /><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span id="ch010_adding-links.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Adding Links</h1>
<p>There are various ways to add links to other sites from your WordPress site. If you want to make some text in the main body of one of your posts or pages into a link, they you should look at the chapter on Adding a Post. <br />
</p>
<p><strong>Links</strong> can also appear as a block on the side of your page. The link block is enabled as a <strong>Widget</strong> <em><strong></strong></em> so if you don't know how to do that you should read the chapter on Using Widgets.</p>
<p>A finished link block might look like the one below:</p>
<p><img src="static/WordPress-wordpress_link_3-en.png" title="wordpress_link_3" alt="wordpress_link_3" width="589" height="510" /></p>
<p>Here the links can be given different <strong>categories</strong> (Local Media, Video Help and WordPress Help). Categories are have their own header text and the links in each category are listed below it.</p>
<p>You can make this section look really good if you put in a bit of effort to link to relevant sites, resources and useful things for your readers. If you link to other people you can get in contact with them and let them know that you have done that. They may link back to you as well if you ask them, and in this way you can increase the readership of your blog and get connected to other related bloggers and groups.</p>
<h2>Deleting Links<br />
</h2>
<p>Click on the <strong>Links</strong> menu item.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/links_1.png" /> </p>
<p>The menu then expands to show you Three options: <strong>Edit</strong>, <strong>Add New</strong> <em><strong></strong></em> and <strong>Link Categories</strong><em><strong>.</strong></em></p>
<p>Click on <strong>Edit</strong> and you'll see that you are given some links to start with:</p>
<p><img src="static/links_2.png" width="600" height="312" /> </p>
<p>We are going to make a fresh start and delete these existing links. Put a tick in the box to the left of each one and select <strong>Delete</strong> from the <strong>Bulk Actions</strong> dropdown menu.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/links_3.png" width="484" height="262" /></p>
<h2>Categories<br />
</h2>
<p>Before we get started adding a link, let's add a category to put our link in.</p>
<p>In this case let's create a category called Local Media. Click <strong>Link Categories:</strong> <br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/links_4.png" width="600" height="410" /><br />
 </p>
<p>You need to give your category a name and a short description of the kind of links you are going to put there. Click <strong>Add New Link Category</strong> and it should appear in the column on the right:</p>
<p><img src="static/WordPress-wordpress_link_5-en.png" alt="wordpress_link_5" width="600" height="349" /><br />
</p>
<p>Keep adding your categories in this way until you are done. </p>
<p>You may also want to set a default link category for your links. You can do this by going to <strong>Settings &gt; Writing Settings</strong> and setting the <strong>Default Link Category</strong> there.<br />
</p>
<h2><img src="static/dashboard_7.png" width="600" height="230" /></h2>
<h2>Adding links<br />
</h2>
<p>Now we are ready to add a link. From the Dashboard, on the left sidebar under the <strong>Links</strong> header, click <strong>Add New</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="static/links_7.png" width="600" height="448" /><br />
</p>
<p>Fill out the details for the link you are going to add. Most importantly the <strong>Name <em></em></strong> of the link, and the <strong>Web Address</strong> of the website you are linking too. The <strong>Description</strong> is optional but gives users more information about the website if they are hovering over the link.</p>
<p>Then put a tick in the <strong>Category</strong> that you want your link to appear in. Finally, click the <strong>Add Link</strong> button on the right of the screen. </p>
<p><img src="static/links_8.png" /><br />
</p>
<h2>Enabling the Links Widget</h2>
<p>If you haven't already added the Links Widget to your sidebar on the Widgets page, you'll need to do that. There is more detailed help in the chapter Using Widgets, but essentially from the Appearance section of the Dashboard navigation, go to the Widgets page and drag the Links Widget to your sidebar.</p>
<p><img src="static/links_9.png" /> </p>
<p>Depending on your theme you may be able to show the description and other information: </p>
<p><img src="static/links_10.png" /></p>
<p>There is also the option of only adding one of the categories of links you have. This gives you more flexibility to show the links in different order on your widgets sidebar.</p>
<p><img src="static/links_11.png" /><br />
</p>
<p>Now when we refresh any page on our blog we should see the Links in the sidebar. Your sidebar should look a bit like the screenshot at the beginning of this chapter.</p>
<h2>More advanced link settings</h2>
<p>Here are some details on Advanced link settings taken from the WordPress codex pages. <span id="ch010_adding-links.xhtml#InsertNoteID_6_marker7" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="adding-links#InsertNoteID_6">1</a></sup></span> <br />
</p>
<p><strong>Image URI</strong> - An image to be displayed with the link. This can either be an absolute URI (<code>http://some.site/images/image.png</code>) or a relative path (<code>/images/some.png</code>). You may want this to be rather small, around 16x16, similar to a favicon.<span id="ch010_adding-links.xhtml#InsertNoteID_8_marker9" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="adding-links#InsertNoteID_8">2</a></sup></span> </p>
<p><img src="static/links_14.png" width="240" height="112" /><br />
</p>
<p><strong>RSS URI</strong>: <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#URI" title="Glossary">URI</a> of the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Feeds" title="WordPress Feeds">RSS feed</a> associated with the link, which will be displayed next to the link itself (if your theme allows it). Example: http://example.com/feed/<br />
<br />
<strong>Notes</strong>: Any notes you want to store, for your own internal use, about the link. Example: Nice design, from #wordpress.<br />
<br />
<strong>Rating</strong>: A ranking of the link, which can be used to sort links within categories.<br />
<br />
<strong>Target</strong>: Specifies the <code>target</code> attribute that will be put onto the link's <code>a</code> tag when displayed on the screen, which tells where the page will appear if the user clicks on the link. There are three options:<br />
</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<p><code>none</code>: open the link in the same window or frame (default).<br />
<code>_top</code>: if you're using frames, open the link at the top level of the frame system.<br />
<code>_blank</code>: open the link in a new window.<br />
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h1>COMMENTS</h1>
<p>Comments are a really important part of why WordPress has become successful. WordPress started life as a blogging software and the ability to get and give public feedback and additional information through comments is the life-blood of blogging.</p>
<p>The ability to add comments to every page and post is the default behaviour of an installation of WordPress. This may be perfect for your needs, or it could be an unwelcome distraction. One thing is for sure, you need to be able to understand how comments work, if only to try to prevent the annoyance that is <strong>comment spam</strong> - unwanted comments often advertising unrelated services. </p>
<p>In this chapter we will look at how to control who can comment on your blog, how to disable comments, and how to prevent unwanted comments. We'll also look at pingbacks which is a system that lets you know if other people have mentioned your posts on their blog or site.<br />
</p>
<h2>Introduction to comments</h2>
<p>To leave a comment, users fill in the comment form at the bottom of your posts and pages. Here is an example of a comment section that is open to visitors of the site to post:<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/comments_3.png" width="600" height="469" /><br />
</p>
<p>The fields <strong>Name</strong> and <strong>Email</strong> are required here, which you can tell by the red asterisk. Clicking the <strong>Post Comment</strong> button will bring you to a page which shows your comment. </p>
<p><img src="static/comments_4.png" width="600" height="190" /></p>
<p>This example shows the message &quot;Your comment is awaiting moderation&quot;. This means that the comment is not visible to other visitors of the site until it has been approved by a site moderator. It's likely they will receive an email similar to the following.</p>
<p><img src="static/comments_5.png" width="564" height="336" /></p>
<p>We can see that the email is a notification that there has been a new comment on the post and offers links to Approve it, Trash it or Spam it.</p>
<p>This email also shows another aspect of comments: if you leave your settings so that unregistered users can post comments, you may well end up with hundreds of spam comments. On the above blog the moderator needs to either disable this kind of open comment making in the <strong>Discussion Settings</strong> or install some anti-spam plugins. There is another chapter detailing anti-spam plugins.</p>
<h2>Approving, trashing or spamming comments</h2>
<p>If you want to take action on a comment that is posted to the site or held for moderation you should visit your <strong>Comments</strong> page on the <strong>Dashboard</strong>. Navigate there by clicking the <strong>Comments</strong> link in the lefthand menu of the Dashboard.</p>
<p><img src="static/comments_6.png" /> </p>
<p>If you have comments that have been previously approved or are awaiting moderation, they will be listed on this page.</p>
<p><img src="static/comments_7_b.png" /><br />
</p>
<p>On the above image you can see that the comment waiting for approval has a pale yellow background. When you hover over the comment you are presented with the following options: <strong>Approve, Reply, Quick Edit, Edit, Spam</strong> <em><strong></strong></em> or <em><strong></strong></em> <strong>Trash</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Approve</strong> is used if you want to publish the comment on the post. <strong>Reply</strong> allows you to respond and then approve the post easily. <strong>Quick Edit</strong> and <strong>Edit</strong> allow you to alter the comment before approving it.<br />
</p>
<p>You may not be sure on the difference between <strong>Trash</strong> <em><strong></strong></em> and <strong>Spam</strong>. If the comment is not appropriate but clearly written about your post, rather than an automated commercial message, then you should use <strong>Trash</strong>. If it is spam and you have the Akismet plugin, using the <strong>Spam</strong> command here will help Akismet become more effective at recognising future spam.</p>
<h2>Discussion Settings</h2>
<p>To change how comments are managed across the whole of your site you need to make changes to your <strong>Discussion Settings</strong>. Navigate there by clicking on <strong>Settings</strong> link on the left hand menu of your Dashboard.</p>
<p><img src="static/comments_8.png" /></p>
<p>Then click the <strong>Discussion</strong> link to view a summary of settings for Comments and Pingbacks (we will explain that more in a bit). </p>
<p><img src="static/comments_1.png" width="600" height="497" /></p>
<p>Here you can see a breakdown of the settings which determine who is allowed to post, whether or not email notification is sent and what has to happen before a comment appears on the live site. The above settings seem pretty good if you have some kind of protection against comment spam and are able to check you site fairly regularly. See the section on anti-spam plugins for more information.</p>
<h3>Disable comments across your whole site</h3>
<p>This can be useful if you want to use your WordPress website as a static website to showcase a project or to share information that doesn't need public feedback. It may be that you prefer visitors to contact you privately via email or are unable to check your site regularly to moderate comments.<br />
</p>
<p>If this is the case simply untick <strong>Allow people to post comments on new articles</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="static/comments_9.png" width="381" height="57" /><br />
</p>
<p>Then click <strong>Save Changes</strong> at the foot of the page.<br />
<img src="static/save_changes.png" /><br />
<br />
</p>
<h3>Enable or Disable comments on individual posts<br />
</h3>
<p><strong>Discussion Settings</strong> on each individual post can be overridden if you need to. The Discussion box can be found towards the bottom of the screen when you add a post or page.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/comments_2.png" /></p>
<p>If the <strong>Discussion</strong> box is not visible, then click the 'screen options' tab near the top right of that page, and tick the appropriate tick box.</p>
<p><img src="/wordpress/_edit/static/comments_discussion_1_600.png" /></p>
<h2>Pingbacks and Trackbacks</h2>
<p>Both Pingbacks and the older system of Trackbacks are ways of letting other bloggers know that you have linked to their posts and made a comment about it. Posts can display these pingbacks as a way of showing the waves your post is making on the internet.</p>
<p>When this is working well, it is a great way of seeing conversation about the ideas in your post spread. However this process can be abused creating pingback spam. Sites which have no interest in your content may link to your site in order to generate a pingback message on your post and in your Dashboard.</p>
<p>If this becomes a problem and you are not very interested in pingbacks then the easiest solution is simply to disable them.</p>
<p>This can be done on a site wide basis by unticking <strong>Allow link notifications from other blogs (pingbacks and trackbacks)</strong>:<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/comments_10.png" width="600" height="175" /></p>
<p>You can also override your default settings by altering the Discussion settings of individuals posts. To do this, untick the setting <strong>Allow trackbacks and pingbacks on this page</strong>.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/comments_2.png" /></p>
<p>In the Discussion box the <strong>trackbacks and pingbacks</strong> links to a page with more information about comments, trackbacks and pingbacks on the Wordpress Codex site:<br />

<h1>Adding Users and User Roles</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will look at how you can add new users to your site and give different <strong>roles</strong> to those users.<br />
</p>
<h2>User roles</h2>
<p>User roles are a way of giving people different levels of access to your WordPress site. For example, it may be that you trust someone enough to contribute to the site, but not enough that they won't delete or alter other posts.<br />
</p>
<p>There are normally five user roles in WordPress. They are: Subscriber (not in wordpress.com), Administrator, Editor, Author and Contributor.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/basic_userroles_1.png" width="140" height="163" /></p>
<p>There is also an extra role called Super Admin which is needed when you have a Wordpress multi-user network.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subscribers</strong> can only manage their own profile (not in Wordpress.com blogs).</li>
<li><strong>Administrators</strong> have access to all the administration features.</li>
<li><strong>Editors</strong> can publish and manage posts and pages as well as manage other users' posts.</li>
<li><strong>Authors</strong> can publish and manage their own posts.</li>
<li><strong>Contributors</strong> are able to write and edit their own posts but can't publish them.</li>
<li><strong>Super Admins</strong> have access to the network administration features if there is a Wordpress network set up (see creating a community).</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
<strong>More Information:</strong> For more information on all of these roles and how to set default roles see the following page: <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities" class="uri">http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities</a><br />
</p>
<h2>Getting started with Users<br />
</h2>
<p>Navigate to the Users page by clicking the <strong>Users</strong> tab of the lefthand menu in the Dashboard.</p>
<p><img src="static/basic_adduser_wpc_1.png" width="194" height="40" /> </p>
<p>Clicking on this link will expand the User menu. You will see the following options: All Users, Add New, Your Profile (or Personal Settings in Wordpress.com):</p>
<p><img src="static/users_1.png" width="176" height="106" /><br />
 </p>
<p><strong>Your Profile</strong> allows you to change your public profile on the site by adding a graphical icon and personal details. Under Personal Settings you can change your password, set Twitter settings and other settings such as the colour of your admin screen.</p>
<h2>Adding users to your WordPress site<br />
</h2>
<p>The process of adding users is slightly different for your own installation of WordPress compared to using Wordpress.com (which is discussed later in this chapter) or if you are adding users to a WordPress multi-user network. There is a separate chapter on this in another part of this manual.<br />
</p>
<p>Click <strong>Users &gt; Add New</strong> in the lefthand menu. Fill out the details of your new user, remembering to choose an appropriate role based on what they will do on the site.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/users_3.png" width="600" height="550" /></p>
<p>When you have completed the form click the <strong>Add New User</strong> button.</p>
<p>You should then return to the default users page where you will see the new user in the list of current users:<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/users_4.png" width="600" height="113" /><br />
</p>
<h2>Adding users in WordPress.com<br />
</h2>
<p><strong>To add a user who already has a WordPress.com log-in</strong></p>
<p>Click on <strong>All Users</strong>. On this screen you will see all of the users who currently are allowed to post to the blog. You should be able to see yourself with the role of administrator. This means you are able to add other users to the blog.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/basic_adduser_wpc_3.png" width="600" height="313" /></p>
<p>Underneath this part of the page is the section where you are able to add other users from the WordPress community. </p>
<p><img src="static/basic_adduser_wpc_4.png" width="600" height="274" /></p>
<p>Interestingly, you have to know the email of the user that you want to add. Presumably this is to stop you randomly adding the username of people that you don't really know. </p>
<p>Enter the email address of the person that you want to add, and select the <strong>Role</strong> you want them to have on your blog, then click <strong>Add User</strong><em><strong>.</strong></em><br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/basic_adduser_wpc_6.png" width="600" height="185" /><br />
</p>
<p>If all goes well you will get the following message:  <br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/basic_adduser_wpc_9.png" /><br />
</p>
<p>However, if the person whose email you entered hasn't already signed up to WordPress.com then you will be shown this message when you click on <strong>Add User</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="static/basic_adduser_wpc_8.png" width="600" height="154" /></p>
<p><strong>To add a user new to Wordpress.com</strong></p>
<p>Go to <strong>Users &gt;</strong> <strong>Invites:</strong></p>
<p><img src="static/basic_adduser_wpc_2.png" /></p>
<p>You can then fill out the form to invite the user to sign up to WordPress and be able to contribute to your blog. You should tick the box to add them as a contributor to your blog.</p>
<p><img src="static/basic_adduser_wpc_10.png" width="600" height="529" /></p>
<p>Now click <strong>Send Invite</strong>. You will get a confirmation message.</p>
<p><img src="static/basic_adduser_wpc_11.png" width="300" height="50" /></p>

<h1>Posts and Pages - What's the Difference?</h1>
<p>This text is adapted from <a href="http://learn.wordpress.com" class="uri" title="http://learn.wordpress.com">http://learn.wordpress.com</a></p>
<p>While publishing posts is the primary way to share content on your site, you can also add additional pages to make it look and feel more like a traditional website. In fact, you can make your whole WordPress site a collection of pages, with a static home page for the landing page. See the upcoming chapter Making a Website Instead of a Blog.<br />
</p>
<p>So what’s the difference between posts and pages?</p>
<p><strong>Posts</strong> are what make a blog a blog — they’re servings of content, similar to journal entries, listed in reverse chronological order. Posts can be as short or as long as you like; some are as brief as Twitter updates, while others are the length of essays.</p>
<p><strong>Pages</strong>, on the other hand, are best suited for more timeless content that you want your visitors to be able to easily access, such as your About Me, Gallery or Contact sections.</p>
<p><img src="http:/learn.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/nested-pages.png?w=640&amp;h=165&amp;h=165" title="nested pages" width="640" height="165" /></p>
<p>Creating new pages is just as easy as adding new posts. Simply go to <strong>Pages &gt; Add New</strong> in your Dashboard.</p>
<p>By default, all posts will appear on your blog’s front page, but you can also display specific posts on category pages (and do other nifty things) with the custom menus feature.</p>
<p>One of your key design decisions will be about what appears on <strong>Posts</strong> or <strong>Pages</strong>. How much of your site do you want to keep as relatively static content? How much should be dynamic content that changes frequently? These issues are dealt with in the chapters &quot;Custom Menus&quot; and &quot;Making a Website Instead of a Blog&quot;. <br />
</p>
<p>If you decide that you’d like to create a Contact page, inserting a contact form is a great way to offer your readers the ability to get in touch, without giving out your personal email address. </p>
<p><span id="ch015_themes.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Using Themes<br />
</h1>
<p>WordPress allows you to change the look of your page by several different methods. The most obvious way is to change the <strong>Theme</strong> your site is using. </p>
<h2>Where do themes come from?<br />
</h2>
<p>Anyone can write themes for WordPress, it is free software after all. If you do a web search for WordPress themes you will see that there are thousands of them. However, not all of them are going to be useful for you. Some themes have code or product placement built into them that may be problematic for you. Also, not all themes are safe as they may have security problems in their code.<br />
</p>
<p>The best place to start looking for themes is <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/" class="uri">http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/</a>. This repository is part of WordPress.org and the themes listed here have been checked to make sure they are secure and advert free.</p>
<p>WordPress.com already comes with a default theme installed. Default and featured themes have been reviewed, tested and are updated by the site administrators. The current default theme for WordPress is called TwentyEleven.</p>
<h2>Managing themes </h2>
<p>To manage the theme of your WordPress site, log in to your blog and in the Dashboard click <strong>Appearance</strong> in the lefthand menu: </p>
<p><img src="static/themes_1.png" width="202" height="327" /><br />
</p>
<p>You will then see your current theme displayed at the top of the page, and underneath it a list of available themes that you can choose from, including the name of each theme and a screen shot.</p>
<p><img src="static/themes_3.png" width="600" height="531" /><br />
</p>
<p>To the right of the <strong>Browse Themes</strong> text there is a box to search for specific themes if you know their names.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/themes_4.png" width="450" height="83" /><br />
</p>
<p>You can filter themes based on certain characteristics; for example, if you wanted to only show themes which have two columns, then you could select that possibility from the grid of options. Click on <strong>Feature Filters</strong> then use the check boxes to make your selection:<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/themes_5.png" width="600" height="274" /><br />
</p>
<p>Here we are looking for a theme with two columns in a light colour that allows us to change the menus flexibly and alter the image in the header of the theme. Click on <strong>Apply Filters</strong> to see the results.</p>
<p><img src="static/themes_6.png" width="450" height="602" /><br />
</p>
<p>You can see that the results show the themes which are tagged with the features that we asked for.<br />
</p>
<h2>Changing themes </h2>
<p>To change to one of the listed themes, you can either <strong>Activate</strong> it (if you are sure this is the theme you want) or you can <strong>Preview</strong> it to see what it would look like with your content. If you are just starting and don't yet have any posts, pages or images on your site, the preview will show some place-holder content.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/themes_7.png" width="300" height="332" /><br />
</p>
<p>Normally if you are browsing for themes you will click on Preview. You will then see a preview of your own WordPress blog in the style of the theme.</p>
<p><img src="static/WordPress-wp_design_5-en.jpg" alt="wp_design_5" width="600" height="186" /></p>
<p>If you don't like the look of the theme or if you are not sure, you can return to the previous page by clicking the &quot;x&quot; <em><strong></strong></em> in the top left of the preview screen:</p>
<p><img src="static/WordPress-wp_design_6-en.jpg" alt="wp_design_6" width="65" height="56" /></p>
<p>If you <em>do</em> like the Theme and want to use it, click the <strong>Activate</strong> link in the top right of the preview screen:</p>
<p><img src="static/WordPress-wp_design_7-en.jpg" alt="wp_design_7" width="192" height="63" /></p>
<p>You can also modify the design of your WordPress blog by adding or changing the contents of additional columns, using <strong>Widgets</strong>; see the chapter &quot;Using Widgets&quot; for information on this.<br />
</p>
<h2>Altering header images for themes </h2>
<p>With some themes you have the ability to change the header image which appears at the top of your blog.</p>
<p><img src="static/theme_header_a_1.png" width="553" height="276" /><br />
</p>
<p>Click <strong>Header</strong> or <strong>Custom Header</strong>, depending on the theme you are using. This may offer you several options depending on the theme you are using. This example uses the Twenty Eleven theme. We are going to upload a different image to be at the top of our WordPress site.</p>
<p><img src="static/theme_header_a_2.png" width="600" height="158" /><br />
</p>
<p>We are going to upload a new header image. If you have access to an image manipulation programme you can make your image be exactly the right size. For this theme, that size is shown as 1000 (wide) x 288 (high) pixels. </p>
<p>There is another option; here we will upload an image which isn't exactly the right size, in this case a background image by maggie-me found on Flickr. WordPress allows you to crop an uploaded header image:</p>
<p>Click <strong>Browse</strong> and <strong>Upload</strong> after you have located the image file on your computer.</p>
<p><img src="static/theme_header_a_3.png" width="600" height="225" /><br />
</p>
<p>You can adjust the crop area using the mouse pointer to drag and drop the lighter area or by using the selection handles, Click <strong>Crop and Publish</strong> when you are happy with your selection.<br />
</p>
<p>You should see a message saying: &quot;Header updated. Visit your site to see how it looks.&quot;</p>
<div class="wrap">

</div>
<p><span id="ch016_using-widgets.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Using Widgets</h1>
<p>WordPress allows you to modify the design and look of your page in several ways; the most obvious way to affect your design is to change the <strong>theme</strong> you are using. Another way is to add <strong>widgets</strong>, which are small pieces of code that add specific sections and functionality to the sidebars of your site.</p>
<p>Note that not all themes are &quot;widget-aware&quot;; if your theme does not define at least one sidebar you will not be able to use widgets on your site.</p>
<h2>Widgets </h2>
<p>A widget could be a bit of text, a calendar, links to other sites or other content that you can include in your blog that aren't blog posts or pages themselves.</p>
<p>By default, WordPress provides some widgets for you. If you haven't changed your theme you might see the following things in your second column:</p>
<p><img src="static/widgets_2.png" width="311" height="541" /><br />
</p>
<p>The sections headed <strong>Recent Posts</strong>, <strong>Recent Comments</strong>, <strong>Archives</strong>, <strong>Categories</strong> and <strong>Meta</strong> are often default widgets.<br />
</p>
<p>You can use widgets as a way to add content boxes with additional information about your site, such as is shown in the example below:<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/widgets_1.png" width="600" height="420" /><br />
</p>
<p>To add widgets to your WordPress blog you must be using a theme which has at least one side column, as this is where widgets are placed. This tutorial outlines how to use widgets on a theme with two columns. If you chose a theme with three columns then the situation will be a bit different but the same principles apply.<br />
</p>
<h2>Adding a simple Widget </h2>
<p>From your Dashboard, navigate to <strong>Appearance &gt; Widgets</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="static/widgets_3.png" /> </p>
<p>You will see a list of <strong>Available Widgets</strong> on the left of the page, and on the right there is a column for different widget areas:<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/widgets_4.png" width="600" height="384" /><br />
</p>
<p>In the example above on the righthand side we see the widget areas for the Twenty Ten theme. To add more widgets, drag and drop the ones you want from the main area (&quot;Available Widgets&quot;) to relevant widget area on the right. If you are not sure where you want the widget to appear, choose the <strong>Primary Widget Area</strong>; you can always change it later.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/widgets_5.png" width="600" height="310" /></p>
<p>As you drag the widget you have chosen into the relevant area, a dark dotted space will appear and move as you move your cursor. When you are happy with where this is, let go of your mouse to drop the widget there.<br />
</p>
<p>When the widget appears in the list, the changes to your layout have been made. You don't need to save anything. However, if you enter settings in the widget itself, you may need to save those.</p>
<h2>Some useful widgets<br />
</h2>
<p>One of the more simple widgets you can add is the <strong>Pages</strong> widget. This will display a list of pages that you have created for your blog in the second column. </p>
<p><strong>Links</strong> are a vital widget to add if you have been using the default WordPress system to add links (see the chapter on Links).  </p>
<p>If you use <strong>Categories</strong> for your posts then you should make sure that that widget gets included to help your visitors find the content you want.<br />
</p>
<p>The <strong>Flickr</strong> and <strong>Twitter</strong> plugins are useful if you use those services. A sample setting for Twitter is shown below.</p>
<p><img src="static/widgets_6.png" /> </p>
<p>Click on <strong>Save</strong> and then view the front page of your site to see the changes. In this example you should see the last 5 tweets of the Twitter user you have entered.</p>
<p><img src="static/widgets_9.png" width="600" height="456" /><br />
</p>
<p>There is a really good resources page on Wordpress.com which outlines how to use widgets and lists the default widgets and what they do.<span id="ch016_using-widgets.xhtml#InsertNoteID_6_marker7" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="using-widgets#InsertNoteID_6">1</a></sup></span>  </p>
<h2>Create a custom text and image widget<br />
</h2>
<p>A more advanced use of a widget is to include text and images. This can be done in many flexible ways to really customise your site. An example is below.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/widgets_15.png" width="505" height="383" /></p>
<p>To create a widget with this image which links to your RSS feed and some text underneath to describe what it is, add a <strong>text widget</strong>. The text widget allows you to include text, images, links and HTML code in your sidebar. </p>
<p>If you already know how to write HTML this next part will be straightforward; in case you don't know HTML, we've provided instructions to create a simple text widget using HTML.<br />
</p>
<p>Navigate to the Widgets page and find the Text Widget in the main area of <strong>Available Widgets</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="static/widgets_12.png" /> </p>
<p>Drag and drop this widget into one of the target areas. As you do this, it will expand to allow you to enter text. If for some reason this doesn't happen, you can click on the arrow in the bar to the right of <strong>Text</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="static/widgets_13.png" width="324" height="124" /> </p>
<p>Now paste some HTML code linking to an image into the text area and add a suitable title.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/widgets_14.png" width="600" height="384" /></p>
<p>Click <strong>Save</strong>. View the front page of your site to see if the results are correct. You should see something like the screenshot below:</p>
<p><img src="static/widgets_a1.png" /> </p>
<p><strong>To create some suitable HTML</strong><br />
</p>
<p>If you are not used to writing HTML then follow these steps.</p>
<p>Find an image which represents your RSS feed and create a new post in your WordPress site which includes any text, images and links you want to include in your widget. Remember that, depending on your theme, your image should be limited in width to around 200 pixels.</p>
<p><img src="static/widgets_10.png" width="600" height="458" /><br />
</p>
<p>Now click on the <strong>HTML</strong> tab of the editor (at the top righthand corner). This will show you the HTML code of this post. If you ever need to create some HTML for other reasons then this is a very easy way of doing it. </p>
<p><img src="static/widgets_11.png" width="600" height="282" /><br />
</p>
<p>Copy the code you see there to the memory of your computer (by selecting all of the text and then using right-click+C, or apple+C). You may also want to save this post as a draft to come back to later.<br />

<p> </p>
<p><span id="ch017_using-menus.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Using Menus</h1>
<p>WordPress allows you to create and change menu lists. Menus are something you might need on a website, especially a WordPress website that isn't just a blog. Menus help you navigate to other pages in your website, and also to links outside your website.</p>
<p>You might choose a theme that already has a menu as part of the layout, in which case you can easily add or remove items from the menu. If you are using or creating a 'blank' theme, you can set up your own menu, name it, and specify it in the PHP code in one of the pages in the WordPress theme.</p>
<h2>Simple Menus<br />
</h2>
<p>Let's look at the easy way of creating and changing a navigation menu first. The current default WordPress theme, Twenty Eleven, has a default menu that is based on the structure and order of pages (to add pages click <strong>Add New</strong> under the <strong>Pages</strong> heading in the lefthand menu of the Dashboard).<br />
</p>
<p>All of your pages should appear as menu items; see below for an example. Here there are five pages listed on the <strong>Pages</strong> section the Dashboard.</p>
<p><img src="static/menus_2.png" width="600" height="394" /><br />
</p>
<p>When we navigate to the front page of the site we can see that those pages are listed in the top menu (as mentioned, this is the default behaviour):</p>
<p><img src="static/menus_1.png" width="600" height="332" /><br />
</p>
<h3>Changing menu order</h3>
<p>It's possible to change the order of the menu items. As you can see from the example above, by default they are listed in alphabetical order. </p>
<p>Choose <strong>Quick Edit</strong> to only change the page order:</p>
<p><img src="static/wp-pages-quickedit-002.png" width="570" height="243" /><br />
</p>
<p>Set the order of one of the pages to be <strong>1</strong> and click <strong>Update</strong>.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/wp-pages-quickedit-001.png" width="570" height="176" /><br />
</p>
<p> Set another page to an order of <strong>2</strong> and click <strong>Update</strong> again. </p>
<p><img src="static/menus_3.png" width="600" height="78" /><br />
</p>
<p> Reloading the front page of the site will show the changes to the order of the menu:</p>
<p><img src="static/menus_4.png" width="600" height="101" /><br />
</p>
<h2>Creating custom menus</h2>
<p>This section is adapted from a page on Wordpress.com support.<span id="ch017_using-menus.xhtml#InsertNoteID_45_marker46" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="using-menus#InsertNoteID_45">1</a></sup></span> <br />
<br />
If you have a theme that supports the Custom Menus feature, you can customise your navigation menu. This allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>change the order of pages</li>
<li>nest pages to create sub-menus</li>
<li>display posts on multiple pages by creating category pages</li>
<li>add posts, tag pages, and custom links to your navigation menu.<br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>From the Dashboard, click on the left-hand menu item called <strong>Menus</strong>, under <strong>Appearance</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="static/menu-button-001.png" /></p>
<p>To create a custom navigation menu, type in a name for it (only you will see this) and click <strong>Create Menu:</strong></p>

<h3 id="ch017_using-menus.xhtml#adding-category-pages-to-your-menu">Adding category pages to your menu</h3>
<p>All posts will appear on your main posts page, but you can also create category pages that only display posts that you’ve designated with a specific category.</p>
<p>Simply check the box of the categories for which you want to create a page, and click <strong>Add to Menu</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="ch017_using-menus.xhtml#adding-static-top-level-tabs">Adding static top-level tabs</h3>
<p>Here’s a nifty way to add static top-level tabs that you can use to organize your content. These tabs are basically place holders – they don’t link to any content, but are there to add structure to your menu items.</p>
<p>Check out the screenshot below: the top-level tab <strong>Media</strong> doesn’t actually link to anything. You can click it, but nothing will happen. It’s solely there to organize links the various media-related menu items.</p>
<p><img src="static/top-level-tabs-2.jpg" width="414" height="258" /><br />
</p>
<p>Here’s how you can add static top-level tabs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Appearance &gt; Menus</strong></li>
<li>Add a <strong>Custom Link</strong> and set the URL as <strong>#</strong>. Using <strong>#</strong> will prevent the page from refreshing when you select the tab.</li>
<li>Label your link and hit the <strong>Add to Menu</strong> button.</li>
<li>Organise your menu items as you would normally, click <strong>Save Menu</strong>, and you’re done!</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/menus/menus-static-tabs/"><img src="http:/en.support.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/menus-static-tabs.jpg?w=460&amp;h=311" title="menus-static-tabs" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-17217" width="460" height="311" /></a></p>
<h3 id="ch017_using-menus.xhtml#activating-your-menu">Activating your menu</h3>
<p>In the <strong>Theme Locations</strong> module, under <strong>Primary Navigation</strong>, select the title of the custom menu you want to activate and click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="http:/en.support.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/activatecustommenu.png?w=302&amp;h=258" title="activatecustommenu" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13534" width="302" height="258" /></p>
<h3 id="ch017_using-menus.xhtml#multiple-menus">Multiple menus</h3>
<p>Most themes have one menu. Some themes, such as the one in the screenshot below, support more than one menu. In both cases, you can create several different menu layouts and independently set the active menu.</p>
<p>If you’ve created more than one custom menu, be sure to activate the right one by selecting it from the dropdown menu and clicking <strong>Save.</strong></p>

<h1>MAKING A WEBSITE INSTEAD OF A BLOG</h1>
<p>If you don't want a list of posts displayed in chronological order on your home page, if you don't want to show any kind of blog but you just want to create a fairly static website, then dive into this chapter!</p>
<p>We have seen already that you can install WordPress and create some pages, and have these page names appear as menu items in a menu that appears on all of the pages. But what do you want to appear on your home page? If you just want a static page, you can create a new page called Home.</p>
<p>Look down the lefthand column of your <strong>Dashboard</strong>, to the tab area named <strong>Settings</strong>, and click the little arrow next to it to expand ...<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/settings-tab.png" /></p>
<p>... and then you will be able to see the various Settings options.</p>
<p><img src="static/settings-expanded.png" /></p>
<p> Choose <strong>Reading</strong>, and change the &quot;Front page displays&quot; setting from &quot;Your llatest posts&quot; to &quot;A static page&quot;, as below:<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/reading-settings.png" width="445" height="188" /><br />
</p>
<p>If you already have made a new page called Home, you can choose that page to display as the landing page to your website. As you can see above, you also have the option of choosing which of the pages you have created will display your blog posts (just in case you still want to have a blog <em>somewhere</em> in your site!).<br />
</p>
<p>So why not make a blog page at this point, by clicking on <strong>Add New</strong> under <strong>Pages</strong> on the Dashboard.</p>
<p><img src="static/making-a-website-blog.png" width="282" height="94" /></p>
<p>Now you can go back to the <strong>Settings &gt; Reading</strong> options, and choose your Blog page as the page which will display your posts:</p>
<p><img src="static/making-a-website-reading.png" width="445" height="189" /></p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You don't need to change any options other than these to make your home page static (no posts) and your blog page display your posts, WordPress figures it out and makes it happen. Thanks, WordPress!<br />
</p>
<p><span id="ch020_adding-audio.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>ADDING AUDIO</h1>
<p>Adding audio clips to your Wordpress site can be done in a number of ways. This chapter is a guide for one of the most simple ways to do it. If you are interested in more possibilities, look at the &quot;Podcasting&quot; chapter as well.</p>
<h2>Using Audio Player Plugin<br />
</h2>
<p>This section applies only to self-hosted sites. If you are on Wordpress.com you can skip to the section at the end of this chapter.</p>
<p>Install and activate the <strong>Audio Player</strong> Plugin <span id="ch020_adding-audio.xhtml#InsertNoteID_12_marker13" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="adding-audio#InsertNoteID_12">1</a></sup></span>. Download and install the plugin in the normal way. This plug in has no settings that need to be altered.<br />
</p>
<h3>Where is your audio file?<br />
</h3>
<p>To be able to add an audio player to your page, you need to know the full URL of the where your audio file is stored. This is a direct link to the mp3 file. In other words you need somewhere to upload your audio to that allows you to directly link to those files.</p>
<p>You may be able to set up your site so that you can upload audio files. Refer to the &quot;Upload Settings&quot; chapter for information about how to do this.<br />
</p>
<p>If you can't upload audio files to your WordPress site then Archive.org is one website that allows this. You can see a link to an Mp3 in the screenshot below:</p>
<p><img src="static/audio_player_4.png" /><br />
</p>
<p>To copy that link you can right-click (Ctrl + Click on Mac) on the link and select <strong>Copy Link Location</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="static/audio_player_6.png" width="278" height="195" /><br />
</p>
<h3> Add the audio to a post<br />
</h3>
<p>Once you have this direct link to the file, you can create an entry in your blog to stream the audio file with the Flash player.</p>
<p>Create a post which describes your file and add the following code within the body text of the entry:<br />
</p>
<pre><code> [audio:http://www.example.org/linkto.mp3]</code></pre>
<p>This will look like this in the Wordpress edit interface:</p>
<p><img src="static/audio_player_1.png" width="600" height="192" /><br />
 </p>
<p>Click <strong>Publish</strong> on the right of your screen and then <strong>View Post</strong>. </p>
<p>If your browser has the Flash player plug-in installed (which is standard in most browsers), you will see a simple player; click on the play arrow to play the audio file from your browser.</p>
<p><img src="static/audio_player_2.png" width="600" height="190" /><br />
</p>
<p>The player is basic but quite functional. You can skip forward to different parts of the file and the time elapsed of the audio file is also displayed. </p>
<p><img src="static/WordPress-wordpress_audio_8-en.jpg" alt="wordpress_audio_8" width="364" height="56" /></p>
<h2>Adding Audio to a WordPress.com site</h2>
<p>The ability to add audio to a site at Wordpress.com is already built in. Follow the instructions above but with a slight change to the short code you add: replace the colon with a space, as shown in the example below. </p>
<pre><code> [audio http://www.example.org/linkto.mp3]</code></pre>
<ol>
<li><span id="ch020_adding-audio.xhtml#InsertNoteID_12">http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/audio-player/<span id="ch020_adding-audio.xhtml#InsertNoteID_12_LinkBacks"><sup><a href="adding-audio#InsertNoteID_12_marker13">^</a></sup></span></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span id="ch021_adding-video.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Adding Video</h1>
<p>This chapter deals with now to embed a video that has been uploaded to a video sharing site into a post.<br />
</p>
<p>To add videos from YouTube, Vimeo and other similar video sharing websites, you can simply copy the URL of the video you want to embed and paste it into your post.</p>
<p>A URL is another name for a web address; you can find this the navigation bar of your browser. To copy the web address/URL to your computer's memory, right-click (ctrl + click on Mac) on the URL and select <strong>Copy</strong> from the menu that appears:</p>
<p><img src="static/addvideo_2.png" width="600" height="447" /></p>
<p>Then in your WordPress blog you can add a new post, give it a title, write a short description and then paste (right-click &gt; Paste) the URL of the video where you want it to appear.</p>
<p><img src="static/addvideo_1.png" width="600" height="410" /><br />
</p>
<p>Click <strong>Publish</strong> on the right of the edit screen, and you will get a message at the top of the screen that you post has been published:</p>
<p><img src="static/add_video_3.png" width="450" height="229" /> </p>
<p>You can then click on <strong>View post</strong> <em><strong></strong></em> to check to see if the embedding of the video has worked. You should see a box showing a still of the video and a play button:<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/WordPress-wordpress_embed_video_13-en.png" alt="wordpress_embed_video_13" width="512" height="490" /></p>
<p>For this method to work you need to have the <strong>Auto Embeds</strong> setting turned on in <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Media</strong>. It is normally on by default but check it if this process doesn't work for you.</p>
<p><img src="static/video_embed_1.png" width="600" height="166" /><br />
</p>
<h2>Controlling the size of videos and using embed codes<br />
</h2>
<p>If you want to control the size of your video on the page when you embed it or if you are using a video sharing site that isn't supported by the WordPress Auto Embed method, then you will need to add your video in a different way.</p>
<p>One way is to use an embed code. Most video sharing sites will give you access to an <strong>embed code</strong>. They all do it in slightly different ways but look for buttons which say <strong>Embed</strong> or <strong>Share</strong>.<br />
</p>
<p> On YouTube, click on the <strong>Share</strong> button underneath the video you want:</p>
<p><img src="static/add_video_9.png" width="450" height="204" /><br />
</p>
<p> Now click on <strong>Embed</strong> to see the embed code you need.</p>
<p><img src="static/add_video_10.png" width="600" height="165" /></p>
<p>Copy this code to your computer's memory (right-click, or ctrl+click on Mac, and select <strong>Copy</strong>).<br />
</p>
<p>In the edit screen for your post, click in the body input field so that the flashing cursor is at the place where you want your video to be appear. If you are in the Visual editor, you will need to change the view from <strong>Visual</strong> to <strong>HTML</strong>.</p>
<p>If you are not sure what this means, have a look at the screen shot below. You will see two tabs to the top right of your editor. The default view is <strong>Visual</strong><em><strong>. </strong></em></p>
<p><img src="static/add_video_5.png" width="450" height="122" /> </p>
<p>Next to it there is a second tab called <strong>HTML</strong>. If you click on it you will see that the formatting icons in the bar above the body input field are replaced by other buttons:<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/add_video_6.png" width="450" height="103" /> </p>
<p>We don't need to know what these Visual and HTML buttons mean right now (they are explained in another chapter), so go ahead and paste in the Embed Code that you copied earlier and give your post a title. It should look something like the screen shot below.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/add_video_7.png" width="600" height="375" /><br />
</p>
<p> If you now switch back to the <strong>Visual</strong> Tab you'll see a square where the video will appear:</p>
<p><img src="static/add_video_8.png" width="448" height="351" /><br />
</p>
<p><br />
If you want to resize the video to make it smaller or bigger you can click on a corner and drag the square to be the size you want. As you drag it you will see the size change and display the news size in pixels. As a test, try making the video 320 pixels wide. <br />
</p>
<p>Click <strong>Publish</strong> and <strong>View Post</strong><em><strong>.</strong></em> You will see that the video now only takes up half or so of the main area of your post.</p>
<p><img src="static/add_video_13.png" width="764" height="373" /><br />
</p>
<p>If you want your text to wrap around your image then you may have to add a little bit of code to the <strong>HTML</strong> view. There may be other ways to do this but learning to tweak the code in the <strong>HTML</strong> view is a good thing to do as it will give you more flexibility on how your posts look.</p>
<p>Edit your post and click the <strong>HTML</strong> tab as explained above. You should see the embed code and any text that you have added to the post.<br />
</p>
<p>Add <strong>align=left</strong> to the embed code as shown in the screen shot below:</p>
<p><img src="static/add_video_15.png" width="600" height="301" /></p>
<p>Now click <em><strong></strong></em> <strong>Update</strong> <em><strong></strong></em> on the right hand of the screen and <strong>View Post</strong>. Your text should wrap around the video.  If you would prefer to have your video on the right, as shown in the example below, add <strong>align=right</strong> to the embed code.</p>
<p><img src="static/add_video_16.png" width="600" height="307" /> </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span id="ch022_universal-subtitles.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Adding Videos with Subtitles</h1>
<p>It is important for your content, and especially videos, to be universally accessible. This chapter outlines some methods to achieve this.<br />
</p>
<h2>Amara</h2>
<p><span></span>You will need a self-hosted WordPress installation (as opposed to Wordpress.com hosting) in order to insert Universal Subtitles videos into your content.You will also need to be either an <strong>Administrator </strong>or <strong>Edito</strong>r as you will need those permissions to add the embed code to your site.<br />
</p>
<p>Amara, created by the Participatory Culture Foundation<span id="ch022_universal-subtitles.xhtml#InsertNoteID_6_marker7" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="universal-subtitles#InsertNoteID_6">1</a></sup></span> , is a toolkit that makes it easy to add subtitles to any video on the web. Universal Subtitles uses only web standard technologies, specifically HTML5 and JavaScript, so it will be accessible in nearly every browser.</p>
<p><img src="static/video_subtitle_1.png" /> </p>
<p>To subtitle a video for Amara, your video first needs to be online. You can upload it to a hosting site such as Youtube, Blip.tv, Dailymotion or Vimeo. Of if you have enough server space you can upload it as a file attachment to the Media part of your WordPress site. Universal Subtitles can work with Ogg, WebM, flv and mp4 video files. <br />
</p>
<p>Once the video is uploaded, visit: <a href="http://universalsubtitles.org/videos/create" class="uri">http://universalsubtitles.org/videos/create</a></p>
<p><img src="static/video_subtitle_3.png" width="600" height="59" /></p>
<p>At the Amara site, enter the location of the video and begin the process of transcribing. The interface is designed to simplify the transcription process by breaking it down into small tasks. </p>
<p>Once your video is uploaded and subtitled, it is easy to insert your video into any WordPress page or post<span id="ch022_universal-subtitles.xhtml#InsertNoteID_7_marker8" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="universal-subtitles#InsertNoteID_7">2</a></sup></span> .</p>
<ol>
<li>First, copy the JavaScript code from the video page at <a href="http://universalsubtitles.org" class="uri">http://universalsubtitles.org</a>.<br />
</li>
<li>Next, create or edit a page or post from the Dashboard of your WordPress site. </li>
<li>Once you are viewing the page or post edit screen, click the <strong>HTML</strong> tab. </li>
<li>Paste the JavaScript code into the HTML edit area.</li>
<li>Publish/update the page or post.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will now have a subtitled video that is accessible to most, or all, of your visitors!<br />
</p>

<h1>Creating an Image Gallery</h1>
<p>You can create an image gallery in a number of ways, including installing a theme that is customised to include image galleries, installing a plug-in, or the simplest way is to create a default image gallery.<br />
</p>
<h2>Creating a default Image Gallery<br />
</h2>
<p>You can create a simple image gallery without having to install any plug-ins, and this will work on Wordpress.com sites as well as your own hosted site. </p>
<p>First upload the images you want in a gallery to a particular post or page. You are able to decide how many images you want to display per row, and decide what happens when your visitors click on an image. A sample image gallery is shown below:<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/image_gallery_5.png" width="600" height="498" /> <br />
</p>
<p>To create a gallery in a post, open the <strong>Add Image</strong> dialogue box as if you were adding a single image to add your first image (see the chapter Adding Images for more information on this). If you are using the Flash uploader you can upload several images at once. If you upload one image at a time, rather than clicking <strong>Insert Into Post</strong> you should click <strong>Select Files</strong> and repeat the process by browsing for another image.</p>
<p><img src="static/image_gallery_1.png" width="600" height="477" /><br />
 </p>
<p>Click <strong>Save All Changes</strong>. <br />
</p>
<p>As you do this you will see the Gallery tab appear and a number will appear next to it. This shows that you have added your images successfully:</p>
<p><img src="static/image_gallery_2.png" width="437" height="250" />.</p>
<p>Click the <strong>Gallery</strong> tab; you will see all of your added images there. You have the chance to add a caption and description, by clicking <strong>Show</strong> on the right of the screen.</p>
<p>There are options for adding your Gallery to this post, for example you can choose how many columns to display. This may depend on the theme you are using and you may want to experiment with this.</p>
<p><img src="static/image_gallery_3.png" width="600" height="296" /><br />
</p>
<p>You can also choose if you want your visitors to see only the image itself when they click on it, or a page with the image within the look of your site. Experiment with both settings for a comparison. I would recommend keeping the <strong>Attachment Page</strong> setting, as it makes it easier for your readers to navigate to different parts of the site. </p>
<p>When you click on <strong>Insert Gallery</strong> you should see a yellow block appear within the body of the post. If you want to add text to the post as well you should click after the yellow box and type there.</p>
<p><img src="static/image_gallery_4.png" width="600" height="384" /> <br />
</p>
<p>Click <strong>Publish</strong>, and then <strong>View post</strong> to see the result of your image gallery, as shown in the first image of this chapter.</p>
<h2>Gallery Short Codes</h2>
<p>The following is a summary adapted from the Wordpress Codex page on Gallery short codes. <span id="ch023_creating-and-image-gallery.xhtml#InsertNoteID_27_marker28" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="creating-and-image-gallery#InsertNoteID_27">1</a></sup></span></p>
<p>The <code>[gallery]</code> shortcode is used in a Post or Page to display a thumbnail gallery of images attached to that post. It can be used in its simplest form like this:</p>
<pre><code>[gallery]</code></pre>
<p>The following basic options are supported:</p>
<dl>
<dt> <strong>columns</strong><em><strong> </strong></em></dt>
<dd>specify the number of columns. The gallery will include a break tag at the end of each row, and calculate the column width as appropriate. The default value is 3. If columns is set to 0, no row breaks will be included. For example, to display a 4 column gallery:
</dd>
</dl>
<pre><code>[gallery columns=&quot;4&quot;]</code></pre>
<dl>
<dt> <strong>id</strong><em><strong> </strong></em></dt>
<dd>specify the post ID. The gallery will display images which are attached to that post. The default behaviour if no ID is specified is to display images attached to the current post. For example, to display images attached to post 123:
</dd>
</dl>
<pre><code>[gallery id=&quot;123&quot;]</code></pre>
<dl>
<dt> <strong>size</strong><em><strong> </strong></em></dt>
<dd>specify the image size to use for the thumbnail display. Valid values include &quot;thumbnail&quot;, &quot;medium&quot;, &quot;large&quot; and &quot;full&quot;. The default is &quot;thumbnail&quot;. The size of the images for &quot;thumbnail&quot;, &quot;medium&quot; and &quot;large&quot; can be configured in WordPress admin panel under <strong>Settings &gt; Media</strong>. For example, to display a gallery of medium sized images:
</dd>
</dl>
<pre><code>[gallery size=&quot;medium&quot;]</code></pre>

<h1>Introduction to Plugins</h1>
<p>A <strong>Plugin</strong> is literally something you &quot;plug in&quot; to your WordPress site to extend its functionality to allow it to do something new. There are thousands of these tiny features that can be added. If you want visitor statistics you can choose from dozens of statistics plugins. If you want to create a testimonial page for your site there are plugins to help you do this. The list of available plugins is vast, and any summary of it will always fall short since new plugins become available every day. </p>
<p>WordPress.com comes with a limited functionalilty and you can't add plugins if your site or blog is hosted there. You need to have a privately hosted site to use plugins. <br />
</p>
<p>You can add these little extra pieces of functionality from within WordPress itself. You can browse them from the admin section of your site. You can read about them, install them, configure them, and remove them all without leaving your Dashboard.</p>
<h2>Activating Plugins</h2>
<p>You can activate plugins that are already installed in the following way.</p>
<p>Navigate to the <strong>Plugins</strong> page from your Dashboard:</p>
<p><img src="static/plugins_wp_1_cropped.png" /></p>
<p>You can read the description of the various plugins you can install there.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/activate_plugin.png" /><br />
</p>
<p>To activate a plugin, just click on the <strong>Activate</strong> link. </p>
<p><img src="static/activate_plugin2.png" /><br />
</p>
<h2>Find and install plugins</h2>
<h3>Finding plugins<br />
</h3>
<p>The &quot;official&quot; source for WordPress Plugins is: <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/" class="uri">http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/</a></p>
<p>Not all WordPress Plugins make it into the above repositories. Try searching the web for &quot;WordPress Plugin&quot; and the keywords for the type of functionality you are seeking.</p>
<p>If you are worried about the security and stability of your WordPress site, you should probably only use the official plugins. These are also easier to find from inside the Dashboard.</p>
<p>To start, click <strong>Plugins</strong> from your Dashboard.</p>
<p><img src="static/plugins_wp_1_cropped.png" /></p>
<p>Click <strong>Add New</strong> and you will see the following screen which allows you to search or browse plugins from the official repository:</p>
<p><img src="static/plugins_fm_1.png" width="600" height="324" /><br />
</p>
<h3>Things to think about before installing plugins</h3>
<p>Always ask yourself, do you really need this plugin on your site? The more plugins you add, the more complex your code becomes. The code may need frequent updating and it may break other parts of your site. </p>
<p>Make sure you read the instructions that come with the plugin and do make a backup of your site and your database before installing plugins. <br />
</p>
<p>Check out this page on the WordPress Codex: things to know before you install: <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation%20">http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation</a><br />
</p>
<h3>Installing plugins</h3>
<p>There are two ways to install WordPress plugins. The traditional way involves transfering the plugin code to your server via FTP or via the command line, and unzipping it to the <code>wp-content/plugins</code> directory of your WordPress installation.</p>
<p>Increasingly, you can install and upgrade plugins directly from your site's Dashboard. </p>
<h3>More Information</h3>
<p>There is more information about plugins on the WordPress codex site:<br />

<p><span id="ch026_anti-spam-plugins.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Anti-spam Plugins</h1>
<p>Comment spam was mentioned in the chapter on comments. Apart from turning off the ability for users to add comments, how can you prevent comment spam? One way is to install an anti-spam plugin.</p>
<h2>Akismet</h2>
<p>Akismet is a system which automatically detects comment and trackback spam. It is an external service run by Automattic, the company that provides WordPress.com.</p>
<p>Akismet can be installed for free on non-commercial websites by installing a plugin that interacts with the Akismet mothership using an <strong>API key</strong>. You can review the spam it catches under &quot;Comments&quot;.<br />
</p>
<p>There is an overview on how to use Akismet on the WordPress Codex site here:  <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins/Akismet" class="uri">http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugins/Akismet</a><br />
</p>
<h2>Other spam plugins</h2>
<p>There are other plugins and ways of stopping comment spam - too many to include everything here, so we will look at two: Captcha plugins and the wp-Spamfree plugin.</p>
<h3>Captcha plugins</h3>
<p>Captcha is a system which asks users to copy a short sequence of letters and numbers which is displayed as an image, therefore only readable by human. This prevents robots from posting comment spam.</p>
<p>If you search for &quot;captcha&quot; in the plugins page of your WordPress site, you will see quite a few alternatives that you can try. </p>
<p><img src="static/comment_spam_1.png" width="600" height="468" /></p>
<p>In this example the SI-Captcha plugin is used: <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/si-captcha-for-wordpress/" class="uri">http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/si-captcha-for-wordpress/</a>.<br />
</p>
<p>After installing the SI-Captcha plugin, users see an addition to the comment form:</p>
<p><img src="static/comment_spam_3.png" width="600" height="528" /></p>
<p>The default settings for the SI-Capture plugin seem to be effective.<br />
</p>
<p>Navigate to <strong>Plugins</strong> <em><strong></strong></em> and then <strong>SI-Captcha Options</strong> in the lefthand menu of your Dashboard.</p>
<p><img src="static/comment_spam_4.png" /> </p>
<p>Here, you are able to set the different users and parts of your site where the form captcha is used.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/comment_spam_2.png" width="600" height="293" /><br />
</p>

<p><span id="ch027_podcasting-plugin.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Podcasting Plugin</h1>
<h1></h1>
<p>This chapter focuses on how the podcasting plugin affects the output of your RSS feed. If you are looking for information on how to get a media player to work, please see the earlier chapters.</p>
<h2>What is a podcast?</h2>
<p>A podcast can be understood as two things: one is a series of audio files published on the internet. The other is a feed of content as an RSS feed which contains media files as enclosures. Often these meanings are used interchangeably because of the history of the term. </p>
<p>Podcasting first became popular through a powerful concept. This was the ability for people to subscribe to podcasts that automatically downloaded audio to their iPod or other similar device. For example, iTunes functions as a directory for free and pay content, and there are now many similar podcast directories. </p>
<h2>Audio podcasting</h2>
<p>Audio and video podcasting is now built-in to WordPress. Just link to an audio or video file in one of your posts, and WordPress will automatically add the necessary enclosure tag to your RSS2 feed to make it useable as a podcast.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> use a complete, absolute URI when linking to the audio file. Otherwise WordPress will not make an enclosure for it.</p>
<p>Wrong: </p>
<pre><code>&lt;a href=&quot;my-podcast.mp3&quot;&gt;My podcast&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Right:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;a href=&quot;http://example.com/my-podcast.mp3&quot;&gt;My podcast&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
<p>If you publish this post and then navigate your browser to the RSS feed of your site, you should see the media file mentioned.</p>
<p>If you look at the source of the page and inspect the RSS code, you will see the following in each entry with a media file enclosed. This is the code needed to make our RSS feed into a podcast.<br />
</p>
<pre id="ch027_podcasting-plugin.xhtml#line79"><code>&lt;enclosure url=&quot;http://www.archive.org/download/DissidentIslandRadio03December2010/DissidentIslandRadio03-12-10.mp3&quot; length=&quot;0&quot; type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>
<h2>Using the Podcasting plugin</h2>
<p>The Podcasting plugin is a solution you can use on your own site to create a video or audio podcast. The players used by the plugin play the following formats: FLV, H.264, MP4, MP3 and AAC.</p>
<p>The plugin does three important things easily: </p>
<ul>
<li>inserts a media player into your post</li>
<li>offers a link to download the media file</li>
<li>inserts the media file into your RSS feed, thus creating a podcast feed.<br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>Download and install the Podcast plugin in the normal way.<span id="ch027_podcasting-plugin.xhtml#InsertNoteID_25_marker26" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="podcasting-plugin#InsertNoteID_25">1</a></sup></span> <br />
</p>
<p>You can activate it from the <strong>plugins</strong> page by clicking <strong>Activate</strong> under the listing of the <strong>Pocasting Plugin by TSG</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/wordpress/_edit/static/wordpress_podcast_8.png" /><br />
</p>
<p>Then you should navigate to its <strong>settings</strong> page to add some details about your plugin and where you want your audio player to appear on the page.<br />
</p>
<h2>Adding audio to your page</h2>
<p>To add an audio player to your page and include an audio file in your podcast, you need to add the URL of your audio file to the podcasting box at the bottom of your page when you <strong>Add a Post</strong>.<br />
</p>
<p>Navigate to your new post page in your usual way, and look to the bottom of the middle of the page.</p>
<p><img src="/wordpress/_edit/static/wordpress_podcast_1.png" width="600" height="157" /><br />
</p>
<p>Enter the location of your mp3 file in the <em><strong></strong></em> <strong>File URL</strong> box of the <strong>Podcasting</strong> section. Some blogs will let you upload audio files, others may ask you to upload large files to other services like the Internet Archive (archive.org) or Soundcloud<span id="ch027_podcasting-plugin.xhtml#InsertNoteID_9_marker10" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="podcasting-plugin#InsertNoteID_9">2</a></sup></span> .</p>
<p>You can then add other information to the podcast by filling out the boxes that you are offered.</p>
<p><img src="/wordpress/_edit/static/wordpress_podcast_2.png" /> </p>
<h3>Choosing where your player appears<br />
</h3>
<p>You can place the audio player in specific places by using the <strong>Send to editor</strong> button after entering the URL of your audio file.<br />
<img src="/wordpress/_edit/static/media_podcasting_send_to_editor.png" /></p>
<p>Place your cursor where you want the player to appear in your text and then click <strong>Send to editor</strong>. This means that you can insert multiple players of different audio files in specific places in your post.</p>
<p>When you save the page you should see a result like the following:</p>
<p><img src="/wordpress/_edit/static/wordpress_podcast_7.png" /></p>
<h2>Configuring your Podcasting plugin settings</h2>
<p>You can change the podcasting settings to automatically put a player in the page above or below your posts, and to add a download link as well.</p>
<p>From your Dashboard select <strong>Settings &gt; Podcasting</strong>.  </p>
<p><img src="/wordpress/_edit/static/wordpress_podcast_3.png" /> </p>
<p>Then you can fill in the basic details about your podcast including its name, an associated image and so on.</p>
<p><img src="/wordpress/_edit/static/wordpress_podcast_4.png" /></p>
<p>You can then set up how you want the audio player to look on your page. I use the following settings which work well for me. Try them out and alter them if you need to.<br />
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Player Location:</strong> Before Content<strong><br />
Text Below the Player:</strong> Download the audio file<strong><br />
Download Link Text:</strong> Below<strong><br />
Player width:</strong> 290<strong><br />
Use Video Player:</strong> no<strong><br />
<br />
</strong>

<h1>Status.net and Twitter Plugins</h1>
<p>There are several useful plugins which allow you to cross-post from a Wordpress blog to Twitter and Status.net (a more open microblogging service).</p>
<p>The information in this chapter is only for self-hosted WordPress sites, but you can achieve much of the same thing using the Publicize function at WordPress.com.<span id="ch028_statusnet.xhtml#InsertNoteID_43_marker44" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="statusnet#InsertNoteID_43">1</a></sup></span> <br />
</p>
<h2>WP-Status.net Plugin<br />
</h2>
<p>To quote from the maintainers' description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every time you make a new blog post this plugin will post a status update to the Status.net servers, facebook, Ping.fm, Google Buzz and Twitter accounts you have specified. You can set as many acounts on as many servers you like.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The plugin is called WP-Status.net and has its own page on the Wordpress.org site here: <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-statusnet/%20">http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-statusnet/</a><br />
</p>
<p>Install and activate the plugin normally. To configure and use the plugin, navigate to <strong>Settings &gt; WP-Status.net</strong> at the bottom of the left column menu: </p>
<p><img src="static/twitter_1.png" /><br />
</p>
<p>You'll then see a list of boxes which allow you to cross-post your blog posts to a number of different services. There is quite a lot of help text within this page to explain the process. Let's look at the bare minimum you need to get this working. Scroll down to the section StatusNet servers and user accounts:<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/twitter_3.png" width="600" height="366" /><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>If you would like to post status updates to the StatusNet servers you use, for example <a href="http://identi.ca/">identi.ca</a>, just fill in <strong>identi.ca</strong> as server, <strong>api</strong> as path and your user name and password.</p>
<p>To turn off updates to a server, just remove the user name for that server and update options.</p>
<p>Post prefix and post suffix are optional, but if you would like to post some text or perhaps a hash tag before/after all your posts you can specify a unique prefix/suffix for each server/account.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>If you want to update Twitter, the process is a bit more complicated as first you have to apply to Twitter for a key. </p>
<h3>Applying for a Twitter Key<br />
</h3>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Register a new application at <a href="http://dev.twitter.com/apps/new">dev.twitter.com/apps/new</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Application Type</strong> must be set to <strong>Browser</strong></li>
<li>the <strong>Callback URL</strong> should be the URL of your blog</li>
<li><strong>Default Access type</strong> MUST be set to <strong>Read &amp; Write</strong><br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>Fill in the <strong>Consumer Key</strong> and <strong>Consumer Secret</strong> in the correct fields - these will show up as soon as you select Server Type &quot;Twitter&quot; and &quot;Oauth&quot; in the server list (user name column).<br />
</p>
<p>Click <strong>My Access Tokens</strong> at http://dev.twitter.com (right menu).<br />
</p>
<p>Fill in your Access Token and the Access Token Secret in the correct fields (password column). Now you should be able to cross-post to Twitter.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>When you have finished adding your details, be sure to click the blue <strong>Update Options</strong> button:<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/update_options.png" /> </p>
<p>Now every time you make a new post, that information and a link should be added to your micro-blogging accounts. </p>
<h2>Twitter Tools Plugin</h2>
<p>Twitter Tools is a plugin that creates a complete integration between your WordPress blog and your Twitter account. It works in much the same way as the WP-Status.net plugin. You should follow the same instructions for applying for a Twitter key. Then navigate to <strong>Settings &gt; Twitter Tools</strong> and fill in the relevant details there.</p>
<p><img src="static/twitter_4.png" width="600" height="484" /><br />
</p>
<h3>Configuring Twitter Tools<br />
</h3>
<p>When you have sucessfully connected to Twitter, the same page at <strong>Settings &gt; Twitter Tools</strong> allows you to set some settings on how your Tweets are cross posted and displayed:</p>
<p><img src="static/twitter_6.png" width="600" height="396" /><br />
</p>
<p>Make sure that <strong>Enable option to create a tweet when you post in your blog?</strong> is set to <strong>Yes</strong>. You can tell this has been successful if you the following box appears in your <strong>Add Post</strong> page:<br />
</p>
<p>  <img src="static/twitter_7.png" /></p>
<p>All of your posts should now be cross-posted to Twitter automatically and draw your many followers to your blog posts. <br />
</p>

</ol>
<p><span id="ch029_calendar-plug-in.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Calendar plugins</h1>
<p>It may be that you want a calendar to display upcoming events or significant dates on your WordPress site. If so, there are quite a few different options for getting that job done.<span id="ch029_calendar-plug-in.xhtml#InsertNoteID_6_marker7" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="calendar-plug-in#InsertNoteID_6">1</a></sup></span> </p>
<p>In this chapter we are going to look at the Events Calendar plugin. One of the reasons for choosing this plugin is that it works in a multi-user WordPress network set up.<br />
</p>
<h2>Events Calendar Plugin<br />
</h2>
<p>You can install the Events Calendar plugin in the normal way. It has a download and information page on WordPress.org.<span id="ch029_calendar-plug-in.xhtml#InsertNoteID_8_marker9" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="calendar-plug-in#InsertNoteID_8">2</a></sup></span> <br />
</p>
<h3>Adding Events to the Calendar</h3>
<p>When you have installed the Events Calendar plugin, navigate to the Events Calendar page by clicking the link on the bottom of the left hand menu:</p>
<p><img src="static/calendar_3.png" /></p>
<p>Scroll down the page and then add the details of the event in the form you see there. An example is shown below.</p>
<p><img src="static/calendar_1.png" width="600" height="588" /></p>
<p>Ticking the box <strong><em></em> Create Post for Event</strong> will do just that and make the event more noticeable on your site. You will be asked if you want post to be a <strong>Draft</strong> post or a <strong>Published</strong> post. Normally it will be Published if you want visitors to your site to see it right away.<br />
</p>
<p>If the process is sucessful, your event should then be visible in the Dashboard view of the Calendar: </p>
<p><img src="static/calendar_2.png" width="600" height="321" /><br />
</p>
<h2>Displaying the Calendar</h2>
<h3><strong>Adding a Widget</strong></h3>
<p>To display a calendar in the sidebar or similar area of your site, you can install a widget in the normal way.</p>
<p><img src="static/calendar_4.png" /></p>
<p>This creates a calendar like the one shown below. The current date is shown with a blue circle and future events are highlighted in red.</p>
<p><img src="static/calendar_6.png" /></p>
<p>When a visitor to the site hovers over the red dates they are shown a summary of what is happening.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/calendar_5.png" /></p>
<p>If they click on the date for more details, a pop up box appears; the rest of the site is greyed out to make the information more prominent:</p>
<p><img src="static/calendar_7.png" /><br />
</p>
<h3><strong>Adding a Calendar to a Page</strong></h3>
<p>If you want to display a large calendar in a post or a page, simply place <code>[events-calendar-large]</code> in the html of the post or page. This can work very effectively if you create a page which you then add to the menu of your site.</p>
<p><img src="static/calendar_8.png" /><br />
</p>
<p>Hovering over the entries gives a full overview of the event and if you click on the title of the event you are taken to a page with more information.</p>
<p><img src="static/calendar_9.png" /><br />

<p><span id="ch030_importing-and-exporting.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Importing and Exporting</h1>
<p>Users of a site may want to import content from past blogs on which they have worked. They may be migrating from popular free services like WordPress.com or Blogger.com to a hosted WordPress site over which they have more control. They may also want to export their content as a back-up to to move elsewhere.</p>
<p>WordPress provides good support to do this through the <strong>Import</strong> and <strong>Export</strong> functions included in the <strong>Tools</strong> section.</p>
<p><img src="static/tools_import_1.png" /></p>
<h2></h2>
<p>Importing Content<br />
</p>
<p>On the Import page of the Dashboard you will see the names of common Blogging software and services listed. You cannot import content immediately: you have to install the relevant plugin for each service.</p>
<p>On the screenshot below you can see a WordPress system where two plugins have been installed: one for importing from other WordPress sites and the other one for importing from Blogger.com sites. You can see that next to those entries it says <strong>Import Posts, comments</strong>, (and so on) but next to the other choices you are prompted to <strong>Install the X importer</strong>.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/tools_import_2.png" width="600" height="382" /></p>
<p>Clicking on <strong>Import &gt; WordPress</strong> bring you to a screen that prompts you to browse for a WordPress eXtended RSS (WXR) file which has a .xml extension. Here's a screenshot:<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/tools_import_3.png" width="525" height="269" /></p>
<p>If you already have one of these files then browse to it and click <strong>Upload file and import</strong>. If not, see the Export Content section.</p>
<p>You may see that there is a limit for the size of file you can upload, and you may also run into problems with the memory limit of your server. There is extensive information about solving these problems in the WordPress Codex. <span id="ch030_importing-and-exporting.xhtml#InsertNoteID_22_marker23" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="importing-and-exporting#InsertNoteID_22">1</a></sup></span> </p>
<p>In the next screen you can decide which user these imported posts are attributed to:</p>
<p><img src="static/tools_import_4.png" width="600" height="313" /><br />
</p>
<p>The default option is the username you are logged in with, but you can also create a new user or attribute them to one of the existing users of the site. In this case the User <strong>radio</strong> is chosen. </p>
<p>There is also the option to <strong>Download and import file attachments</strong>. If you want to make the posts you are importing self sufficient and not link out to external content, you should tick this option.<br />
</p>
<h2>Exporting Content</h2>
<p>To export content from your WordPress site to somewhere else, navigate to the Export page in the Tools part of the Dashboard.</p>
<p><img src="static/tools_export_1.png" width="600" height="357" /><br />
</p>
<p>Select how much of your content you wish to export; in the example above, I've selected <strong>All Content</strong>. Click <strong>Download Export File</strong>. Save the .xml file somewhere safe and you can then import it to another WordPress site or similar system.<br />

<h1>Installing WordPress</h1>
<p>If you have no experience with installing software on servers and do not want to learn, then this process may not be for you. You may wish instead to visit a site which gives out free WordPress installs and create a blog there. Some examples are <a href="http://wordpress.com," class="uri">http://wordpress.com,</a> <a href="http://network23.org" class="uri">http://network23.org</a>, <a href="http://blogsport.eu" class="uri">http://blogsport.eu</a>. </p>
<p>However, if you have time, and access to a webspace, then it can be well worth installing your own version - to increase privacy and control over your set-up.</p>
<h2>Pre-requisites <br />
</h2>
<p>You need some basic system administrations skills and the following to install WordPress on your server (it is beyond the scope of this guide to walk you through each technology, so a high level of prior understanding is assumed):<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MySQL</strong> 5.2.4<strong> </strong> or better (other <strong>SQL</strong> variants will require additional configuration not covered by this chapter)</li>
<li><strong>PHP </strong> 5.0 or better</li>
<li>The mod_rewrite module for Apache webserver.<br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>You will also need the following skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>familiarity with <strong>FTP</strong>/<strong>FTPS</strong> including setting directory permissions</li>
<li>OR confidence with decompressing archives and changing file ownership in <strong>shell.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Quick Guide to Installing WordPress</h2>
<p>Here's the quick version of the instructions, for those that are already comfortable with performing such installations. This guide is from the WordPress codex pages. More detailed instructions<span id="ch032_installling-on-a-server.xhtml#InsertNoteID_27_marker28" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="installling-on-a-server#InsertNoteID_27">1</a></sup></span>  are also on the WordPress codex pages.</p>
<p>If you are not comfortable with renaming files, Steps 3 and 4 are optional and you can skip them as the install program will create wp-config.php file.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and unzip the WordPress package if you haven't already.</li>
<li>Create a database for WordPress on your web server, as well as a MySQL<span id="ch032_installling-on-a-server.xhtml#InsertNoteID_19_marker20" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="installling-on-a-server#InsertNoteID_19">2</a></sup></span>  user who has all privileges for accessing and modifying it.</li>
<li>Rename the <code>wp-config-sample.php</code> file to <code>wp-config.php</code>.</li>
<li>Open <code>wp-config.php</code> in a text editor<span id="ch032_installling-on-a-server.xhtml#InsertNoteID_21_marker22" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="installling-on-a-server#InsertNoteID_21">3</a></sup></span>  and fill in your database details<span id="ch032_installling-on-a-server.xhtml#InsertNoteID_23_marker24" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="installling-on-a-server#InsertNoteID_23">4</a></sup></span>  as explained in Editing wp-config.php<span id="ch032_installling-on-a-server.xhtml#InsertNoteID_25_marker26" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="installling-on-a-server#InsertNoteID_25">5</a></sup></span>  to generate and use your secret key password.</li>
<li>Upload the WordPress files in the desired location on your web server:
<ul>
<li>If you want to integrate WordPress into the root of your domain (e.g. <code>http://example.com/</code>), move or upload all contents of the unzipped WordPress directory (but excluding the directory itself) into the root directory of your web server.</li>
<li>If you want to have your WordPress installation in its own subdirectory on your web site (e.g. <code>http://example.com/blog/</code>), create the <code>blog</code> directory on your server and upload WordPress to the directory via FTP.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Run the WordPress installation script by accessing <code>wp-admin/install.php</code> in a web browser.
<ul>
<li>If you installed WordPress in the root directory, you should visit: <code>http://example.com/wp-admin/install.php</code></li>
<li>If you installed WordPress in its own subdirectory called <code>blog</code>, for example, you should visit: <code>http://example.com/blog/wp-admin/install.php</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>That's it! WordPress should now be installed.</p>
<h2>Configuring WordPress </h2>
<h3>Adding Users<br />
</h3>
<p>The initial administrator user name is &quot;admin&quot; (without the quotes). Type that in the user field and paste the password in the password field. If you are working on a shared computer, do not check the &quot;Remember me&quot; box.</p>
<p>The first thing that should be done upon logging in is to create a new user for yourself with a memorable password.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Users</strong> tab towards the right side of the top menu bar.</li>
<li>Scroll down the page until you see the <strong>Add New User</strong> heading.</li>
<li>Enter your username, your email address and your new password. Set the Role drop down menu to Administrator and click <strong>Add User</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>File Permissions<br />
</h3>
<p>After finishing the WordPress install you should change the permissions of the web root directory to something more secure. There is more information on this in the section Securing Your Installation.  </p>
<h3>Media Upload Settings<br />
</h3>
<p>Before getting started with adding media to your website you may need to have a look at the limits imposed by your server. The default settings of your server may mean that you have a fairly small limit set to upload files. This may be come clear when you try to upload a file that is over the <strong><em>Maximum upload file size</em></strong>.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/installing_1.png" width="490" height="193" /><br />
</p>
<p>You to change this limit you need to overwrite those configurations by adding the following into your .htaccess file. The #Change upload limits is just a comment. You can put these lines before or after any other script in you .htaccess file. Save it and upload. That's it! Hope this helps!</p>
<p>#Change upload limits</p>
<p>php_value memory_limit 34M<br />
php_value post_max_size 33M<br />
php_value upload_max_filesize 32M<br />
php_value max_execution_time 600</p>
<p>#Change upload limits end</p>
<p>There other ways to change this setting that are listed in a support thread on the WordPress support site.<span id="ch032_installling-on-a-server.xhtml#InsertNoteID_29_marker30" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="installling-on-a-server#InsertNoteID_29">6</a></sup></span>  <br />
</p>
<h3>Keeping Wordpress Updated</h3>
<p>Now you have successfully installed Wordpress, you need to make sure that you keep it (and all the themes and plugins) updated. Failure to keep Wordpress updated will expose you to an increased risk that your blog or website could become compromised by a malicious attacker.<br />
</p>

<h1>INSTALLING WITH SUBVERSION</h1>
<p>If you have shell access to your web server, you can use a different technique for installing and updating WordPress. This technique uses a tool called Subversion to automatically download and install the WordPress files on your web server.</p>
<p>The really useful part is that you can use Subversion to seamlessly upgrade your WordPress installation to the latest version, which helps to keep your copy of WordPress secure. This technique will just install or update the core Wordpress files. Use the built-in WordPress system for installing and updating themes and plugins.<br />
</p>
<p>From The Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion" title="Subversion">Subversion Page</a>:</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Apache Subversion</strong> (often abbreviated <strong>SVN</strong>, after the command name <em>svn</em>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning" title="Software versioning">software versioning</a> and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control" title="Revision control">revision control</a> system founded and sponsored in 2000 by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CollabNet" title="CollabNet">CollabNet</a> Inc. Developers use Subversion to maintain current and historical versions of files such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code" title="Source code">source code</a>, web pages, and documentation. Its goal is to be a mostly-compatible successor to the widely used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System" title="Concurrent Versions System">Concurrent Versions System</a> (CVS).&quot;</p>
<p>Although Subversion is mostly used by developers, it can also come in handy for normal users who need to keep their files up to date with a remote repository. In this case, it makes installing and updating a WordPress site really quite simple.</p>
<h2>Getting started with Subversion</h2>
<p>The first step is to check that you have command line (or shell) access to your website.</p>
<p>You should be familiar with the Secure Shell (or SSH) command. To connect to your web server you would issue a command like:</p>
<p> $ ssh -v -C you@yourdomain.com</p>
<p>In the example above, you should substitute your own username and the correct domain you use for accessing your web server.</p>
<p> The &quot;-v&quot; switch tells SSH to print messages so you can see what is happening, and the &quot;-C&quot; turns on compression to speed things up over slow connections.</p>
<p>For more useful information on SSH, see :</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Internet_Technologies/SSH" class="uri" title="SSH Book">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Internet_Technologies/SSH</a><br />
</p>
<p>Once you are connected to your web server, you need to check to see if Subversion is installed. To check, issue the following command:</p>
<p> $ which svn</p>
<p> If Subversion is installed, you should see something like:</p>
<p>$ /usr/bin/svn</p>
<p>If you don't see anything, it means that Subversion is not installed on the web server. In that case you need to contact an administrator and ask them to install it for you. If you have the administrator (or root) password for your Debian GNU/Linux based web server you can install Subversion by issuing the following command (as root):</p>
<p> $ apt-get install svn</p>
<p>We will now assume that you have successfully connected to your web server with SSH and have Subversion installed.</p>
<h2>Installing WordPress with Subversion<br />
</h2>
<p> The first thing you need to do is decide where you want to install WordPress.</p>
<p>WordPress needs to be installed into a directory on the web server machine that the web server software has access to. On GNU/Linux servers running Debian based distributions, it is common for the directory to be named 'public_html'.</p>
<p>If you need to, create the directory:</p>
<p>$ mkdir public_html</p>
<p>Now change into the new directory:</p>
<p>$ cd public_html</p>
<p>You are now almost ready to use Subversion to install WordPress - but first you need to choose which version to install. There are two main options - &quot;trunk&quot; or &quot;stable&quot;. In WordPress parlance, &quot;trunk&quot; represents the very latest &quot;bleeding edge&quot; version of the software. For our purposes, you will probably want to install the &quot;stable&quot; version instead.</p>
<p> To find the latest version, check <a href="http://core.svn.wordpress.org/tags/" class="uri" title="Wordpress Releases">http://core.svn.wordpress.org/tags/</a></p>
<p>At the time of writing, the latest stable version is 3.2.1</p>
<p>To install a fresh copy of WordPress 3.2.1 using Subversion:</p>
<p>$ svn co http://core.svn.wordpress.org/tags/3.2.1 .</p>
<p>Let's have a closer look at the command above. The first part, &quot;svn&quot;, is the subversion command itself; &quot;co&quot; stands for &quot;check out&quot;. &quot;http://core.svn.wordpress.org/tags/3.2.1&quot; is the URL of the version of WordPress we are checking out, and finally the &quot;.&quot; fullstop (or period) tells Subversion to install the files into the current working directory. Don't forget the fullstop or the command won't work!</p>
<p>Once you run this command, you will see a lot of information scroll past as Subversion connects to the remote hosts and copies all of the necessary files to your web server. When finished, you will see a message like:</p>
<p>Checked out revision 18636.<br />
</p>
<p>This means that the Subversion Checkout process has completed successfully. You now need to finish the installation by editing <code>wp-config-sample.php </code>to add to your database details. Save the file as:<code></code></p>
<p> <span>wp-config.php</span></p>
<p>Now visit your blog URL to finish the install, just a like a standard WordPress install.</p>
<h2>Updating WordPress with Subversion<br />
</h2>
<p>Subversion makes updating WordPress really straightforward. To update your WordPress installation (once connected to your web server with SSH):</p>
<p>Check the latest available version of Wordpress here:</p>
<p><a href="http://core.svn.wordpress.org/tags/" class="uri" title="Wordpress Releases">http://core.svn.wordpress.org/tags/</a><br />
</p>
<p>Change to the WordPress directory:</p>
<p>$ cd public_html</p>
<p>Instead of &quot;Checkout&quot;, we use the Subversion switch (sw) command when updating.<br />
</p>
<p>Issue the following command, substituting &quot;3.2.1&quot; for the version you wish to upgrade to:</p>
<p>$ <code>svn sw http://core.svn.wordpress.org/tags/3.2.1/ .</code></p>
<p>This will automatically upgrade WordPress while leaving custom or edited files like wp-config.php and your plugins untouched.</p>
<p>Once Subversion has done it's thing, visit:</p>
<p><code>http://www.yourdomain.com/wp-admin/upgrade.php</code></p>
<h2>Converting a traditional WordPress install</h2>
<p>If you have a pre-existing WordPress install that you would like to update using Subversion, you will first need to convert it by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make a backup of your files and database and disable all plugins first.</li>
<li>Create a new temporary directory.</li>
<li>Use the Subversion commands from above to checkout WordPress (trunk or stable version) into it.</li>
<li>Copy all your custom files from the existing WordPress location to the temporary directory. This includes config files, plugins and images or media files.<br />
</li>
<li>Rename the temporary directory to match the old directory name.</li>
<li>Run the WordPress update script (by going to your admin page - /wp-admin/) and test everything.</li>
</ol>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span id="ch034_security.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Securing your Installation</h1>
<p>Security for your WordPress site is something that varies in importance depending on your situation and your perspective. The danger of not being concerned with security is that your site, including the files and the entries of the database, could be corrupted or totally deleted. It could also effect other users and sites on your server. This may seem like a vague and remote possibility - until it happens to you. In this chapter we look at file permissions, how to keep your WordPress system updated and how to make backups.<br />
</p>
<p>For a good overview of all of these issues there is a detailed and informative entry on the WordPress codex site called Hardening WordPress. <span id="ch034_security.xhtml#InsertNoteID_14_marker15" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="security#InsertNoteID_14">1</a></sup></span> <br />
</p>
<h2>File Permissions</h2>
<p>Understanding file permissions on the files uploaded to your server is a very important piece of keeping your WordPress installation secure. There is an excellent guide on permissions on the WordPress Codex site which explains what file permission are, and most importantly how to change them. <span id="ch034_security.xhtml#InsertNoteID_12_marker13" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="security#InsertNoteID_12">2</a></sup></span>  </p>
<p>If you are very restrictive when it comes to file permissions then it means that some of the best functions of WordPress like being able to upload and edit images just don't work. It makes sense to start off being restrictive, but if you find that WordPress and plugins that you have added start complaining with error messages, you can then open up the permissions of the relevant files or directories.</p>
<p>This may sound confusing, but normally any problem that you encounter will have been replicated by someone else. This means that you are likely to find relevant help if you search for the problems you are having in WordPress forums.<br />
</p>
<h2>Keeping your system updated</h2>
<p>New versions of plugins, themes and the core code of WordPress are released regularly. It is important to keep these updated otherwise your system may get cracked. Before updating there are some steps you should perform to make sure things go smoothly - or at least not disastrously. These include checking the server requirements of the update, making backups and disabling plugins. You should check the official docs on the Codex for full information. <span id="ch034_security.xhtml#InsertNoteID_18_marker19" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="security#InsertNoteID_18">3</a></sup></span> <br />
</p>
<p>WordPress now has the ability to perform <strong>Automatic Updates</strong><em><strong>.</strong></em></p>
<p>To be able to perform automatic updates you normally need one of the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>to have FTP access your server</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>to have your WordPress folders given write access by the same user that runs your webserver (eg. www-data for apache on debian)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do allow your WordPress files to be owned by your webserver user, automatic updates should just work. If not, you may be prompted for your FTP details as shown in the screenshot below.<img src="static/automatic_update_1.png" width="600" height="313" /></p>
<h3>Security Issues of Automatic Updating</h3>
<p>Having your folders and files writable by the user that runs your webserver is not ideal for security reasons. If you are on a shared server then it makes your system open to being hacked by the other users on that server, so therefore is not suitable. </p>
<p>FTP updating on the other hand solves the problem of permissions on shared hosts but often FTP is disabled by server admins who are security conscious and prefer their users to log in by more secure means like SSH. <span id="ch034_security.xhtml#InsertNoteID_16_marker17" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="security#InsertNoteID_16">4</a></sup></span> <br />
</p>
<p>You may have to compromise some of your security concerns to be able to update automatically.<br />
</p>
<h2>Keep back-ups of your WordPress files and databases</h2>
<p>One of the most essential approaches to security is to admit that your system is not invulnerable, and make regular back-ups that can be restored. After all, it could even be you that hacks and breaks your system by mistake.<br />
</p>
<p>You will need to make back-ups of the files needed for your WordPress site/s and the database/s used. You can do this process yourself manually or if you know a little about scripting and have access to another server then it is possible to set up your system to do this automatically. There is great information on the specifics of making back-ups, both manual and automated, on the WordPress Codex site.<span id="ch034_security.xhtml#InsertNoteID_8_marker9" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="security#InsertNoteID_8">5</a></sup></span>   <br />

<p><span id="ch035_optimization.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Optimization</h1>
<p>Optimizing your site can involve several aims. One is to make sure that it is as quick to use as possible for the people viewing it and posting to it. We can call this optimizing performance.  Another may involve Search Engine Optimization (SEO) which makes your site easier to find on search engines and will increase the amount of visitors to your site.<span id="ch035_optimization.xhtml#InsertNoteID_20_marker21" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="optimization#InsertNoteID_20">1</a></sup></span> <br />
</p>
<h2>Optimizing Performance </h2>
<p>There are many ways of increasing the performance of your system which are detailed on the WordPress Codex pages. <span id="ch035_optimization.xhtml#InsertNoteID_28_marker29" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="optimization#InsertNoteID_28">2</a></sup></span> </p>
<h3>A minimal approach to plugins and themes<br />
</h3>
<p>If you are having problems with the amount of time that your pages take to load this may be caused by a plugin or a theme that is coded in an inefficient way. Try restoring your default theme and then disabling plugins one by one this may well allow you to find out which plugin or theme is causing you problems.</p>
<p>Generally, it is a good idea to only install the plugins and themes that you really need. If you don't need it, then deactivate it and delete it from your system.</p>
<h3>Caching plugins<br />
</h3>
<p>The easiest way to make sure that your pages load quickly in a browser for the people viewing your site it to use a plugin to enable caching. A caching plugin such as WP Super Cache or W3 Total Cache can be easily installed and will cache your WordPress posts and pages as static files. This reduces the load on the server and improves performance dramatically, especially on a busy site.</p>
<p><img src="static/optimization_2.png" width="600" height="194" /><br />
<br />
Let's look at WP Simple Cache as an example of how to use this kind of plugin. Download and activate the plugin in the normal way. If you see an error like the following you will need to adjust some of your systems file permissions (see the File Permissions section in the Securing your Installation chapter):</p>
<pre><code>Warning: WP Simple Cache plugin was not able to write cache
directory
&quot;/srv/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/wp-simple-cache/cache/&quot;.
 Please make the cache dir is writable.</code></pre>
<p>When this is corrected you should point your browser to <strong>Settings &gt; WP Simple Cache</strong> in our Dashboard. </p>
<p>In the <strong>Easy</strong> tab, make sure that the <strong>Caching On</strong> radio button is selected.</p>
<p><img src="static/optimization_3.png" width="600" height="391" /></p>
<p>To test the system is working, click <strong>Test Cache</strong>. This process also shows us a little about how caching works.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/optimization_4.png" width="373" height="255" /> </p>
<p>The process of testing is listed when we get the results of the test. Two copies of the front page of the site being testing are fetched. There is a delay between when the copies are requested. If caching isn't working then the timestamps will be different as the page will be generated fresh each time. If you see the result, &quot;The timestamps on both pages match!&quot; this means that caching is working.</p>
<p>For more information on setting up the plugin via the advanced settings, visit the home page of the WP Super Cache plugin. <span id="ch035_optimization.xhtml#InsertNoteID_26_marker27" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="optimization#InsertNoteID_26">3</a></sup></span><br />
</p>
<h2>Search Engine Optimization within WordPress</h2>
<p>WordPress, straight out of the box, comes ready to embrace search engines. Its features and functions guide a search engine through the posts, pages, and categories to help the search engine crawl your site and gather the information it needs to include your site within its database.</p>
<h3>Permalinks<br />
</h3>
<p>Permalinks are useful for SEO. The term Permalinks is a way of describing semantic links which have the name of your post, the date, or the category of the post in the URL of the post being displayed. </p>
<p>An example would be the difference between the URL of a post<code> http://mysite.org/2011/09/09/a-face-in-the-crowd/</code> rather than <code>http://</code><code>mysite.org</code><code>/index.php?p=645</code></p>
<p>To set up &quot;pretty&quot; permalinks you do need to be able to have certain things installed on your server - specifically there is a module in Apache called mod_rewrite. <span id="ch035_optimization.xhtml#InsertNoteID_22_marker23" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="optimization#InsertNoteID_22">4</a></sup></span> <br />

<p>Once the Permalinks set-up is installed, you can control how links look. To do this point your browser to the <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Permalinks page</strong> in your dashboard.</p>

<h2>SEO Plugins</h2>
<p>You can add to the built-in abilities of WordPress by adding any number of SEO plugins. Search Engine Optimization is all about competing for a better rank. Therefore it only seems suitable that even within the collaborative area of a free software project there is competition between different SEO plugins. Here is a quote from the developer of the Wordpress SEO plugin:<br />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It's not a secret that the author of this plugin, Joost de Valk, aka Yoast, doesn't really like All In One SEO Pack. The main reason is that All in One SEO pack has a default option for auto generating meta descriptions that is actually making it harder for people to rank well in a lot of cases, giving them a false sense of security.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason for mentioning this piece of backstabbing, apart from the humour of it, is to point out one of the main tasks of SEO plugins, which is to insert <strong>meta tags</strong> into the pages and posts of your site. This hidden, &quot;meta&quot; information can be included in the code of your site and helps to give your pages higher ranking on Search Engines.</p>
<p>Examples of the most common <strong>meta tags</strong> include:<span id="ch035_optimization.xhtml#InsertNoteID_24_marker25" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="optimization#InsertNoteID_24">5</a></sup></span> </p>
<pre><code>&lt;meta name=&quot;resource-type&quot; content=&quot;document&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;content-type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=US-ASCII&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;content-language&quot; content=&quot;en-us&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;author&quot; content=&quot;Harriet Smith&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;contact&quot; content=&quot;harrietsmith@harrietsmith.us&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;copyright&quot; content=&quot;Copyright (c)1997-2004
Harriet Smith. All Rights Reserved.&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;Story about my dog
giving birth to puppies.&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;keywords&quot; content=&quot;stories, tales, harriet, smith,
harriet smith, storytelling, day, life, dog, birth, puppies, happy&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>
<p>While WordPress does a lot of thing out of the box, it does not try to guess these tags.</p>
<p>The quote above also points out the main difference between various SEO plugins. Some will try to guess this meta data and automatically insert it, and others will make it easy for you to get into the detail of it and write your own meta tags <strong><em></em></strong> for best results.</p>
<p>The choice is up to you - whether you want a plugin that does some of the work for you or allows you to add lots of fine tuning. There are several well written articles comparing different SEO solutions on the web. <span id="ch035_optimization.xhtml#InsertNoteID_41_marker42" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="optimization#InsertNoteID_41">6</a></sup></span>  </p>

<p><span id="ch036_analytics.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Analytics</h1>
<p>If you want to know the movements and numbers of people visiting your WordPress site, you can use an external analytics software or you can install a plugin for this.</p>
<p>Statistics plugins and softwares enable you to view a broad range of information about your website visitors such as which web browsers they are using, their geographic location, pages visited, referring website, and more<span id="ch036_analytics.xhtml#InsertNoteID_6_marker7" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="analytics#InsertNoteID_6">1</a></sup></span>. This information is not intended to identify individual users, although certain aspects such as IP address or the combination of operating system, browser, and other attributes may be exclusive to an individual<span id="ch036_analytics.xhtml#InsertNoteID_8_marker9" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="analytics#InsertNoteID_8">2</a></sup></span>. Analytics are generally designed to give a statistical basis with which to make decisions about site design, outreach tactics, usability, and other issues.</p>
<p>You may wish to disable some of the record gathering features of these analytics tools for privacy reasons. For example, the ability to log IP addresses may cause concern when it comes to the controversial area of data retention.<span id="ch036_analytics.xhtml#InsertNoteID_16_marker17" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="analytics#InsertNoteID_16">3</a></sup></span> It is possible to set up an analytics tool so that it acts just as a page counter for the different areas of your site<br />
</p>
<p>There are several popular analytics packages on the internet that can be integrated into WordPress with relative ease. This chapter gives an introduction to some of these solutions, but there are plenty of other solutions out there.<span id="ch036_analytics.xhtml#InsertNoteID_51_marker52" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="analytics#InsertNoteID_51">4</a></sup></span> <br />
</p>
<h2>OpenWebAnalytics</h2>
<p>The OpenWebAnalytics package is open source, GPL licensed (the same license as WordPress).<br />
</p>
<h2>WP Slim Stat</h2>
<p>According to the developers Slim Stat is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lightweight but powerful real-time web analytics plugin for WordPress. Spy your visitors and track what they do on your website. <span id="ch036_analytics.xhtml#InsertNoteID_53_marker54" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="analytics#InsertNoteID_53">5</a></sup></span> <br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are some details on their installation page that is worth knowing about if you are considering using Slim Stat for a network of sites.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Database usage: WP SlimStat needs to create its own tables in order to maintain the complex information about visits, visitors, browsers and countries. It creates 3 new tables for each blog, plus 3 shared tables (6 tables in total, for a single-user installation). Please keep this in mind before activating WP SlimStat on large networks of blogs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Install and activate the plugin in the normal way and then navigate to the <strong>Settings &gt; SlimStat Config</strong> page to set your configuration. </p>
<p><img src="static/ss_screenshot-3.png" /> </p>
<p><img src="static/ss_screenshot-2_2_1.png" width="593" height="388" /><br />
</p>
<p>When you have set up the system then you can check to see if it is working by viewing the Stats for your website:</p>
<p><img src="static/ss_screenshot-4_1.png" width="600" height="452" /><br />
</p>
<p>The Dashboard show the total number of hits. But a more accurate representation of how many people are looking at your site is show in the <strong>Visitors</strong> tab. <br />
</p>
<h2>Piwik</h2>
<p>Piwik is an external stats service that needs a separate install. WP-Piwik is a WordPress plugin which allows you to sync one site or even a network of sites to your Piwik install. There is documentation on installing and using Piwik on their site.<span id="ch036_analytics.xhtml#InsertNoteID_47_marker48" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="analytics#InsertNoteID_47">6</a></sup></span> </p>
<p>You install and activate the WP-Piwik plugin in the normal way. Then get an auth code from your Piwik installation and enter it in <strong>Settings &gt; Piwik</strong>.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/analytics_2_1.png" width="600" height="192" /><br />
</p>
<h3>Piwik Plugins and AnonymizeIP<br />
</h3>
<p>One of the handy things about Piwik is the number of plugins that you can enable for it.</p>
<p><img src="static/analytics_1png" width="600" height="254" /><br />
</p>
<p>Navigate to the <strong>Plugins</strong> tab of your Piwik installation to see the currently activated plugins and those that are ready to activate.</p>
<p>In the screenshot above we can see one particularly useful plugin called AnonymizeIP. This allows you to anonymize the details of the IP addresses that are stored in the database. To do this you will need to make sure that the following is included in the global.ini.php files in the config directory and that the AnonymizeIP plugin is installed. There are more details on how to do this here - <a href="http://forum.piwik.org/read.php?2,1810%20">http://forum.piwik.org/read.php?2,1810</a><br />
</p>
<pre><code>; number of octets in IP address to mask, in order to anonymize a visitor&#39;s IP address
; if the AnonymizeIP plugin is deactivated, this value is ignored
; for IPv4 addresses, valid values are 0..4
ip_address_mask_length = 4</code></pre>

<p><span id="ch038_installing-a-wordpress-network.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Installing a WordPress Network</h1>
<p>A <strong>WordPress Network</strong> is an installation of WordPress with many sites hosted in one place. The same code is used for all the different sites hosted on the network, thus reducing the time it takes to keep the code updated. This used to be called a Multi User set up, so you may still see references to <strong>WordPress MU</strong> when researching this subject. <br />
</p>
<p>This chapter is partly adapted from the the official WordPress documentation on creating a WordPress multi-user network. There are two ways to install a network: one is to use sub-directories, the other is to use sub-domains.</p>
<p><strong>Sub-directory:</strong> http://wpnetwork.org/examplesite/<br />
<strong>Sub-domain:</strong> http://examplesite.wpnetwork.org</p>
<p>In this chapter we are only going to look at sub-directories. For information on how to set up a network with sub-domains and more in depth information about WordPress networks, have a look at the Create a Network page on the Wordpress Codex site. <span id="ch038_installing-a-wordpress-network.xhtml#InsertNoteID_10_marker11" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="installing-a-wordpress-network#InsertNoteID_10">1</a></sup></span> </p>
<h2>Summary of how to install a network</h2>
<p>Back up your system before starting this process. There is information on how to do this in the Securing Your Installation chapter.</p>
<p>Then alter the wp-config.php file in the root directory of your set up. Add this line above the part where it says <code>/* That's all, stop editing! Happy blogging. */</code>:</p>
<pre><code>define(&#39;WP_ALLOW_MULTISITE&#39;, true);</code></pre>
<p>This will bring up some new settings in your Dashboard. Point your browser to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Network Setup</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="static/network_setup_2.png" /></p>
<p>This page presents you with the correct settings to complete the configuration of your network.</p>
<p><img src="static/network_setup_1.png" width="600" height="500" /></p>
<p>The text in the boxes that you see may be different to the screenshot above, depending on your set-up.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<p>Now, back up your existing <code>wp-config.php</code> and <code>.htaccess</code> files.</p>
</dt>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<p>Create a <code>blogs.dir</code> directory under <code>/wp-content/</code><br />
This directory is used to stored uploaded media for your additional sites and must be writable by the web server. <span id="ch038_installing-a-wordpress-network.xhtml#InsertNoteID_21_marker22" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="installing-a-wordpress-network#InsertNoteID_21">2</a></sup></span> <br />
</p>
</dt>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<p>Add the extra lines your WordPress installation generates into your <code>wp-config.php</code> file. <span id="ch038_installing-a-wordpress-network.xhtml#InsertNoteID_23_marker24" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="installing-a-wordpress-network#InsertNoteID_23">3</a></sup></span> <br />
These lines are dynamically generated for you based on your configuration. Edit the <code>wp-config.php</code> file while you are logged in to your sites admin panel. Then paste the generated lines immediately <strong>above</strong> <code>/* That's all, stop editing! Happy blogging. */</code>.</p>
</dt>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<p>Add the generated mod_rewrite rules to your <code>.htaccess</code> file, replacing other WordPress rules. (If there isn't an <code>.htaccess</code> file, then create it.) These lines are dynamically generated for you based on your configuration.</p>
</dt>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<p>Log in again. Once the above steps are completed and the new wp-config.php &amp; .htaccess files are saved, your network is enabled and configured. You will have to log in again. Click <strong>Log In</strong> to refresh your Adminstration Panel. If you have problems logging back in, clear your browser's cache and cookies first, then try again.</p>
</dt>
</dl>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">More information on .htaccess and mod_rewrite</span></h3>
<p>Unlike Single Site WordPress, which can work with &quot;ugly&quot; Permalinks<span id="ch038_installing-a-wordpress-network.xhtml#InsertNoteID_25_marker26" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="installing-a-wordpress-network#InsertNoteID_25">4</a></sup></span>  and thus do not need mod_rewrite, MultiSite requires its use to format URLs for your subsites. This necessitates the use of an .htaccess file, the format of which will be slightly different if you're using sub-directories or sub-domains.</p>
<dl>
</dl>
<p>To enable mod_rewrite to work within an Apache Virtual host you may need to set some options on the DocumentRoot. The code below is an example which you can alter to suit your system.<br />
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
  DocumentRoot /var/www/vhosts/wordpress
  &lt;Directory /var/www/vhosts/wordpress&gt;
    AllowOverride Fileinfo Options
  &lt;/Directory&gt;</code></pre>
<p><span id="ch038_installing-a-wordpress-network.xhtml#.htaccess_and_Mod_Rewrite"></span></p>
<h2>Altering your Network Settings</h2>
<p>To change settings to the whole network, navigate to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Network Settings</strong>.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/network_admin_7.png" /> </p>
<p>At the <strong>Network Settings</strong> page you can change the name of the network, the admin email, how people can register, whether or not site administrators can add users to their sites themselves, and other settings. Have a look at these settings and fill them out as you see fit.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/network_admin_6.png" width="600" height="456" /></p>
<h3><br />
Upload Settings<br />
</h3>
<p>You can also determine which file types users of the network are allowed to upload at <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Network Settings</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="static/network_admin_9.png" /><br />
</p>
<p>Scroll down the page and you will see various options under <strong>Upload Settings</strong> including <strong>Media upload buttons</strong>, <strong>Site upload space</strong>, <strong>Upload file types</strong> and <strong>Max upload file size</strong>.<br />
<br />
<img src="static/network_admin_10.png" width="600" height="281" /><br />
</p>
<p>The Media upload buttons refer to the buttons above the WYSIWYG editor which are used to add text to posts and pages.<br />
</p>
<p>It may be a good idea to enable the Video button even if you are not allowing your users to add Video files. This is because it will enable different options for embedding video files from external websites.</p>
<p>You can decide how much space and what kinds of files your users may upload. Make sure you provide help for your network's users to find other solutions (such as Vimeo, Soundcloud, Flickr, etc) if you want to run a minimal file hosting service. <br />
</p>
<h3>Menu Settings<br />
</h3>
<p>There is a check box on the <strong>Network Settings</strong> page which allows you to decide if users of the network get to see the Plugins menu settings or not.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/network_admin_13.png" width="596" height="88" /><br />
</p>
<p>This allows you to create a more generic and potentially easier to user service, but with a bit less flexibility for its users.</p>

<h1>WordPress network admin</h1>
<p>This chapter looks at some of the things you should know about admin for WordPress networks. The way that networks work is a little bit different than single site installs. <br />
</p>
<h2>Creating a Site</h2>
<p>To create a site you should be logged in to your WordPress network as a user with the Super Admin role. When logged in, navigate to the Network Dashboard by clicking <strong>My Sites &gt; Network Admin &gt; Dashboard</strong> on your top navigation bar.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/network_admin_a2.png" width="535" height="145" /> <br />
</p>
<p> It's important to recognise the difference between the Dashboards of your blogs and the Dashboard of the WordPress Network - otherwise you may end up doing things to the whole network that you only wanted to apply to your own blog.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/network_admin_5.png" width="600" height="276" /> <br />
</p>
<p>The Network Admin page has a section at the top left of the page where you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a New Site</li>
<li>Create a New User</li>
<li>Search Users</li>
<li>Search Sites</li>
</ul>
<p>It also lets you know how many sites and users you currently have using the system.</p>
<p>To add a new site, click <strong>Create a New Site</strong> in this panel or click <strong>Add New</strong> under the Sites Menu on the left of the screen.</p>
<h1><img src="static/network_admin_1.png" width="600" height="327" /></h1>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">User Access</span></h2>
<p>Creating a WordPress network creates the need for a new user role, <strong>Super Admin</strong>. A Super Admin can create new sites and make changes to the configuration that affect the whole network. Super Admins can access the Network Admin section, which is a dashboard to control the whole network.<br />
</p>
<p>By default, all users who are added to your network will have <strong>subscriber</strong> access to <strong>all sites</strong> on your network. To allocate a different default role for users on individual sites, you must use a plugin, such as <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/multisite-user-management" class="external text" title="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/multisite-user-management">Multisite User Management</a>.</p>
<p>The capabilities of the site administrator role are also reduced in a WordPress Network. Site admins cannot install new themes or plugins and cannot edit the profiles of users on their site. Only the Network Admin (aka Super Admin) has the ability to perform these tasks in a WordPress network.</p>
<h2>Installing Themes and Plugins</h2>
<p>Installing themes and plugins to a WordPress network is a similar process to installing them on a WordPress single site. You need to be in the Network Admin part of the site as shown above.</p>
<p>When you have installed the plugin, you then need to perform an additional step which is to <strong>Network Enable</strong> the new theme or plugin. To do this, navigate to the Themes or Plugins page and search for the plugins you have just installed, then click <strong>Network Enable</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="static/networkadmin1.png" width="600" height="168" /><br />
</p>
<p><span id="ch040_useful-wordpress-network-plugins.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Useful WordPress Network Plugins</h1>
<p>This chapter details some of the plugins that could be useful for users of a WordPress network to help create a strong community. </p>
<h2>WordPress Sitewide Tags</h2>
<p>One of the things that you can do to help create a community is to create a page where all the Tags of the posts of the network are displayed. This can be achieved with the plugin WordPress Sitewide Tags.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/network_plugins_swt_4.png" width="600" height="389" /><br />
</p>
<p>Install the plugin in the normal way and then go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Sitewide Tags</strong>.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/network_plugins_swt_1.png" /></p>
<p>Fill out the settings below. The following are recommended, apart from the setting <strong>Include Pages</strong>, as this may give you a lot of <strong>About</strong> tags.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/network_plugins_swt_2.png" width="600" height="355" /></p>
<p>At the foot of this page in the <strong>Populate Posts</strong> section, tick <strong>All blogs</strong> and click <strong>Populate Posts</strong>. After a short time, you should see a tag cloud like the one above at the <strong>/tags</strong> page. <br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/network_plugins_swt_3.png" width="600" height="252" /><br />

<h2>MU Network Domain Mapping</h2>
<p>If one of the sites within your WordPress network has registered a domain name and wants to have their own URL for their site, it is possible to &quot;map&quot; that domain onto their site within the network. </p>
<p>The first step is to install a plugin called <strong>WordPress MU Domain Mapping <span id="ch040_useful-wordpress-network-plugins.xhtml#InsertNoteID_6_marker7" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="useful-wordpress-network-plugins#InsertNoteID_6">1</a></sup></span></strong>. Install the plugin in the normal way, then you will need to do a little tweaking to get it fully working. These instructions are based on the installation notes for the plugin.</p>
<p>Note: do not define COOKIE_DOMAIN in your wp-config.php as it conflicts with log-ins on your mapped domains.</p>
<p>Make sure the default Apache virtual host points at your WordPress MU site or WordPress 3.0 network so that it will handle unknown domains correctly. On some hosts you may be required to have a dedicated IP address. A quick check: in a web broswer, type in the IP address of your install. If you are using cPanel, use the <strong>Park a Domain</strong> menu to set the mapped domain to your main installation. If this doesn't make sense to you, then this may be something you have to ask your server admin or provider to do.<br />
</p>
<p>Install the plugin manually by downloading the zip file and unzipping it in your /wp-content/plugins/ directory, as explained elsewhere in the manual. Then activate and network enable the plugin.</p>
<p>Inside the folder wordpress-mu-domain-mapping there is a file called sunrise.php. Move the sunrise.php file into wp-content/. If there is a sunrise.php there already, you'll just have to merge them as best you can.<br />
</p>
<p>As a Super Admin for the network, you should change the settings for the plugin at the <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Domain Mapping</strong> page of the Network Admin Dashboard.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/network_plugins_2.png" /> </p>
<p>Enter the IP address of your server. </p>
<p><img src="static/network_plugins_3.png" width="600" height="332" /><br />
</p>
<p>There are also some Domain configuration options which follow. More detailed instructions about these configuration can be found on the installation page of the plugin. <span id="ch040_useful-wordpress-network-plugins.xhtml#InsertNoteID_8_marker9" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="useful-wordpress-network-plugins#InsertNoteID_8">2</a></sup></span> It is worth mentioning that the <strong>User domain mapping page</strong> affects whether the domain mapping is controlled by Super Admins or by Administrators of the individuals sites.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/network_plugins_4.png" width="450" height="205" /></p>
<p>In the above example, domain mapping is controlled on the level of the User / Administrator of the individual site's Dashboard rather than only being controlled in the Network Admin Dashboard.<br />
</p>
<h3>Settings for each Domain Mapping<br />
</h3>
<p>When users want to set their own domain mappings, this is done by adding the domain in <strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Domain Mapping</strong> in the Dashboard of the site you wish to map the domain to. </p>
<p><img src="static/network_plugins_5.png" /> </p>
<p>Enter the domain you want to point to the site. Put a tick in the box <strong>Primary domain for this blog</strong>, then click <em><strong>Add</strong></em>.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/network_plugins_8.png" width="263" height="216" /> </p>
<p>If you want the domain to also work with &quot;www&quot; in the URL, you must enter that into the <strong>Add new domain</strong> box as well.</p>
<p><img src="static/network_plugins_7.png" width="345" height="368" /></p>
<p>For full information on setting up domain mapping, see the home page of the domain mapping plugin. <br />

<h1>Buddy Press</h1>
<p>BuddyPress is a way of creating a community in your WordPress site or network of sites. It is commonly used to create networks in universities, private companies or communities of interest. It does this by building common social media possibilities into a network of WordPress blog users.</p>
<h2>Features of BuddyPress</h2>
<p>For a full breakdown of the features of BuddyPress you can visit the project's home page. <span id="ch041_buddy-press.xhtml#InsertNoteID_10_marker11" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="buddy-press#InsertNoteID_10">1</a></sup></span> Some of the most notable and useful features are: <strong>Activity Streams, Extended Profiles, Friend Connections, Private Messages, Private Messaging, Groups</strong> and <strong>Discussion Forums</strong>.<br />
<br />
<img src="static/buddypress_1.png" width="600" height="405" /><br />
</p>
<h2>How does BuddyPress work?</h2>
<p>BuddyPress is a plugin for WordPress which you download and install in the normal way. You need to then install a theme which is compatible with BuddyPress.</p>
<p><img src="static/buddypress_5.png" width="600" height="236" /><br />
</p>
<p> After installing the plugin you will get this message: <br />
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>BuddyPress is ready</strong>. You'll need to <a href="http://clearerchannel.org/wordpress/wp-admin/themes.php">activate a BuddyPress compatible theme</a> to take advantage of all of the features. We've bundled a default theme, but you can always <a href="http://clearerchannel.org/wordpress/wp-admin/theme-install.php?type=tag&amp;s=buddypress&amp;tab=search">install some other compatible themes</a> or <a href="http://clearerchannel.org/wordpress/wp-admin/plugin-install.php?type=term&amp;tab=search&amp;s=bp-template-pack">upgrade your existing WordPress theme</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you navigate to the <strong>Appearance</strong> section of your Dashboard, you will see the new default theme.</p>
<p><img src="static/buddypress_6.png" width="294" height="333" /> </p>
<p>When you click <strong>Activate</strong>, the installation will be complete. </p>
<p>BuddyPress adds a lot of extra functionality and significantly alters the way your site works. You can only use certain themes for BuddyPress and these themes will significantly alter the front page of your network to highlight the BuddyPress features that you have enabled. These features include Activity Streams, Group Directory, Member Directory and Blog list.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/buddypress_3.png" width="600" height="183" /></p>
<h2>Configuring BuddyPress</h2>
<p>The default settings for BuddyPress offer a lot of functionality. You may not need or want a lot of the things that are possible for your network. With this in mind, the makers of BuddyPress have made it easy to disable these features. Navigate to <strong>Component Settings</strong> in the new BuddyPress section of your Dashboard. </p>
<p><img src="static/buddypress_8_2.png" /></p>
<p>Select only the functions that you want. You may want to test some of them out on a site before asking the users of your network to use them. Some features, such as Groups, look a bit sad and lonely if you enable them but they are then are not used. It may be that you decide to introduce these features one by one to your network.</p>
<p><img src="static/buddypress_7.png" width="600" height="575" /></p>
<p>You may want to change the information that users are allowed to enter on their profile page. This is especially useful if your network is set up for a community of interest which has specific information they want to share. The <strong>Profile</strong> page is a great place to have that information.<br />
</p>
<p>To add extra fields for information, navigate to <strong>Profile Field Setup</strong> under the BuddyPress menu.</p>
<p><img src="static/buddypress_16.png" /></p>
<p>You can set the name and description of a field and choose what kind of field you want it to be: <strong>Text Box, Date Selector, Radio Buttons, Drop Down Select Box, Multi Select Box</strong> or <strong>Check Boxes</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="static/buddypress_19.png" width="584" height="424" /></p>
<h2>Quick guide to using BuddyPress</h2>
<p>Documenting how to use all of the possible features of BuddyPress is beyond the scope of this chapter. However, here is a quick guide to getting started. There is good support in the BuddyPress support forums.<span id="ch041_buddy-press.xhtml#InsertNoteID_16_marker17" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="buddy-press#InsertNoteID_16">2</a></sup></span> </p>
<h3>Joining Groups</h3>
<p>To join a Group in your BuddyPress network, go to the <strong>Group Directory</strong> by clicking this menu item under the <strong>Community</strong> tab.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/buddypress_10.png" width="332" height="139" /></p>
<p>From the list, you can join groups which interest you by clicking <strong>Join Group</strong> to the right of the group name and description.</p>
<p><img src="static/buddypress_11.png" width="598" height="264" /></p>
<h3>Adding Friends and Messaging Users</h3>
<p>When you have joined groups and watched the activity which happens there, you may want to message other users and add them as friends.</p>
<p><img src="static/buddypress_12.png" width="600" height="143" /></p>
<p>For example you may want to have a discussion with the user krishna c about their question in the screenshot above.<br />
</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this is to click on their username or avatar to go to their profile page.  </p>
<p><img src="static/buddypress_13.png" width="539" height="180" /></p>
<p>To add the user as a friend just click the <strong>Add Friend</strong> button. </p>
<p>If you click <strong>Public Message</strong> you are given a message box starting with the user's username for your message. This message will be visible to all other users.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/buddypress_14.png" width="600" height="106" /><br />
 <br />
If you want to send a <strong>Private Message</strong>, click on that button to go to the message section of your BuddyPress Dashboard.</p>
<p><img src="static/buddypress_15.png" width="600" height="341" /></p>
<p>You can see there that there is already an entry in the Send To box so just fill in the Subject and Message, and click <strong>Send Message</strong>.<br />
</p>
<h2>Extending BuddyPress<br />
</h2>
<p>There are a large number of extra features that can be enabled through adding extra plugins to your WordPress/Buddy press system. <span id="ch041_buddy-press.xhtml#InsertNoteID_14_marker15" class="InsertNoteMarker"><sup><a href="buddy-press#InsertNoteID_14">3</a></sup></span> </p>
<p>Many of these plugins can be used on WordPress sites without BuddyPress and some are written especially for BuddyPress installations.<br />
