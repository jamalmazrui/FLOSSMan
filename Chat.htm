<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>Using the Chat Activity, you can send messages to your friends about things like your journey to school or your favorite animal. You need at least two computers to use the Chat Activity - your own and the one that your friend uses.</p>
<p><img src="static/Sugar-share-chat_image_7-en.png" title="chat_image_7" alt="chat_image_7" width="600" height="450" /> </p>
<p>Chatting can be fun, and you can communicate with more than just one other person.</p>
<p><span id="ch004_startchat.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Starting Chat</h1>
<p>Chat is a collaborative Activity that lets you hold a text-based conversation with others. Chat must be shared to be useful - without sharing, it does nothing.</p>
<p>If there is an existing chat session you want to join, see JOIN CHAT. Otherwise, start Chat as described below, and either invite others to join, or share it publicly with the neighborhood.<br />
</p>
<p>You can start the Chat Activity from one of two places - the Home View and the List View. Look at the Home View first to see if it is in the ring of favorites:</p>
<p><img src="static/Chat-StartChat-chat-en.png" title="chat" alt="chat" width="464" height="521" /></p>
<p>Your Home View may look quite different. You can look for the image that the arrow is pointing to above. It is the <strong>Chat</strong> Activity icon. Click this icon to start the Chat Activity.</p>
<p>If you do not see the Chat Activity icon, go to the top right of the screen in the Home View and click this icon, which is for the List View:</p>
<p><img src="static/Chat-StartChat-list-en.png" title="list" alt="list" width="59" height="46" /></p>
<p>When you see a list of Activities, scroll down the list until you see the Chat Activity icon:</p>
<p><img src="static/Chat-StartChat-chatlist-en.png" title="chatlist" alt="chatlist" width="406" height="510" /></p>
<p>Click the <strong>Chat</strong> icon to start the Activity.<br />
</p>
<p>Or you may want to add the Chat Activity to your Home View, to make it easier to get to. (The Home View is the screen you see when you start the computer.)</p>
<p>To add it, click the star on the left side of the icon. Now you can return to the Home View and start Chat from there.</p>
<p>To return to the Home View: </p>
<p>Go to the top of your screen and click this icon.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/Chat-StartChat-homeview-en.png" title="homeview" alt="homeview" width="58" height="52" /></p>
<p>Now you can start Chat by clicking the <strong>Chat</strong> icon in Home View.</p>
<h2>Sharing Chat</h2>
<p>You can either share Chat publicly, for any other XO to join, or keep it private but invite specific people to join.</p>
<h2>Sharing Chat publicly</h2>
<p>In the Chat toolbar, you see &quot;Share with: Private&quot;. Click Private and select &quot;My Neighborhood&quot;.</p>
<p>Chat is now shared publicly for others to join. All other XOs that you see in your Neighborhood View should be able to see your shared Chat, and join it.<br />
</p>
<h2>Sharing Chat privately</h2>
<p>In the Chat toolbar, you see &quot;Share with: Private&quot;. Leave that as private, but with Chat as your current Activity, switch to Neighborhood View, and find a friend that you want to invite to a private Chat. Hold the pointer on their icon, and in the popup menu, select &quot;Invite to&quot;. A Chat icon appears in the menu.</p>
<p>They then get an invitation to Chat appearing on their frame, as well as your Chat icon appearing in their Neighborhood View.</p>
<p>You can invite as many other XOs to your Chat as you like, creating a private group discussion.</p>
<p>Anyone else who joins can invite others.<br />
</p>
<p><span id="ch005_joinchat.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Join a Chat</h1>
<p>You can join a Sugar Chat that has already been started.</p>
<p>Two or more XO computers from One Laptop Per Child can speak to each other directly without an Internet connection. This is a direct connection. You can also chat with people on the Internet who use Sugar. This section describes joining a chat between two or more XO computers from One Laptop Per Child.<br />
</p>
<p>First, look at the Neighborhood View to see if there is an existing Chat you want to join.</p>
<p><strong>CHAT SAFELY</strong>: Only chat with someone you know. If a someone invites you to chat, don't chat with them unless you know them.<br />
</p>
<p><span> </span><br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/Sugar-share-chat_invite_5-en.png" title="chat_invite_5" alt="chat_invite_5" width="600" height="450" /></p>
<p>If you see a XO icon with a little speech bubble icon next to it, that person is in a shared Chat. Several people may be around the Chat icon, showing a group Chat.<br />
</p>
<p> <img src="static/Chat-JoinChat-join_chat_chat_available-en.png" alt="join_chat_chat_available.png" width="42" height="67" /><br />
</p>
<p>Click the little speech icon <img src="static/Chat-JoinChat-join_chat_chat_available_bubble-en.png" alt="join_chat_chat_available_bubble.png" width="42" height="28" /> and select the <strong>Join</strong> option.</p>
<p>Then the Chat Activity starts, connected to the shared Chat. You see the other people in the Chat, on the Frame.<br />
</p>
<h2>Chatting<br />
</h2>
<p>Once you are in the Chat Activity, you can begin typing to send a message and chat with the other person. After you type a message you can press the <strong>enter</strong> key to send it.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/Sugar-share-chat_image_8-en.png" title="chat_image_8" alt="chat_image_8" width="600" height="450" /></p>
<p>To enter messages type them in the box at the bottom of the Chat Activity. Always press <strong>enter</strong> at the end of the message. Once you press <strong>enter</strong> your message appears on your friend's computer.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Accept an invitation to chat</h2>
<p>You may be invited to chat. An invitation appears as a little speech icon <img src="static/Chat-JoinChat-join_chat_chat_available_bubble-en.png" alt="join_chat_chat_available_bubble.png" width="42" height="28" /> in the upper-left of the screen in every view. (The invitation also appears on the Frame.) The colors of the icon match the colors of the friend who sent the invitation.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/Sugar-share-chat_invitation_1-en.png" title="chat_invitation_1" alt="chat_invitation_1" width="600" height="79" /><br />
</p>
<p>You accept the invitation by hovering over the icon and selecting <strong>Join</strong>. You decline the invitation by selecting <strong>Decline</strong>.<br />
</p>

<h1>Things to Do with Chat</h1>
<p>Chat is a great for sending messages back and forth with a friend, socializing, and working together on projects.</p>
<p>Remember that being polite on a computer is just as important as being polite when you're speaking with someone. </p>
<ul>
<li>Be polite. Try not to interrupt.</li>
<li>Read through what people are saying before you say something.</li>
<li>Don't type in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS. This style is considered rude as it is like shouting at someone.<br />
</li>
<li>If you do not speak the same language as another person it may be difficult to communicate with Chat. Be patient. If you have an Internet connection, you can try going to <a href="http://www.google.com/translate">www.google.com/translate</a> and type in a phrase that you want to say in another language so you can be friendly online. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fun<br />
</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It can be fun to make words shorter when typing in a Chat Activity because it is faster, like texting (sending messages) on a mobile phone. For example instead of typing in &quot;how are you?&quot;, you can type in &quot;how r u?&quot;<br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>  The following are some ways you might like to try using Chat:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arrange a time to meet friends to play.<br />
</li>
<li>Organize a community gathering.<br />
</li>
<li>Bring friends together to talk about doing a group project.</li>
<li>Brainstorm ideas (either &quot;fast and furious&quot; or by taking turns).<br />
</li>
<li>Ask your teacher questions about your homework.<br />
</li>
<li>Use Chat and write a story with friends online using the Write Activity.</li>
<li>Use Chat to practice writing in a foreign language (see if you can find a native speaker to chat with).<br />
</li>
<li>Organize other Sugar or XO users to meet and learn from each other.</li>
<li>Use Chat to communicate with a grandparent or other family member.<br />
</li>
<li>Interview an expert using the Chat Activity as if they were in the classroom, especially an expert who wouldn’t otherwise be able to visit.</li>
<li>Take group discussion notes.</li>
<li>Play a word-association game such as typing the first word that comes to mind when your friend types red.<br />
</li>
<li>Play a role-playing game (for example, have a friend pretend to be a character from a book you are reading, and chat with the role-playing friend).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Use emoticons in Chat</h2>
<p>There are ways to tell friends how you feel just by using letters - they can let someone know if you are happy, sad, or having fun. When you make letters look like a face, they are called emoticons.<br />
</p>
<p>Some are written so that you read them sideways.</p>
<p>This is a happy face:<br />
</p>
<p>:)  </p>
<p>This is a sad face:</p>
<p>:( </p>
<p>This is a wink:<br />
</p>
<p>;)</p>
<p>See if you can find the keys on the keyboard to make the faces</p>
<p>The two dots are the colon key <strong>:</strong> and the semicolon key ;<br />
</p>
<p>The mouth are the parentheses keys ()<br />
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You can also make faces that go across:<br />
</p>
<p>Happy<br />
</p>
<p>(^_^)</p>
<p>Sad</p>
<p>(&lt;_&gt;)</p>
<p>Winking (^_~)<br />
</p>
<p>What other emoticons can you create with text in the Chat Activity?</p>
<p>Can you draw pictures using only the text symbols on your keyboard? This combination of a symbol and a number looks like a sideways heart &lt;3. &quot;I &lt;3 my XO&quot; means, &quot;I love my XO.&quot;</p>
<h3>ASCII art<br />
</h3>
<p>See if you can make an XO Computer:</p>
<p> \___/<br />
 |___|  <br />
 \___\ </p>
<p>or a bicycle:</p>
<p>   __o<br />
 _ \&lt;,_<br />
(<em>)/ (</em>)</p>
<p>What else can you make?</p>
<h2>Make Friends</h2>
<p>When you are in the Neighborhood View, if you move the pointer over someone, you can see their name, and click <strong>Make Friends</strong>. When you Make Friends, your new friend appears in your Group View list.<br />
</p>
<p>The Group View list helps you keep a list of your friends online who you like chatting with. </p>
<h2>Read a past log of conversations</h2>
<p>If you open the Journal Activity to open the Chat in the detail view, you can choose to open the Chat Activity with the Write Activity instead of the Chat Activity window.</p>
<h2>Notes for parents and teachers</h2>
<p>Chat presents a great opportunity engage children in reading and writing. The natural inclination for children to socialize and express themselves can be channeled in some of the exercises outlined above. (Some children who are by their nature shy and reserved, are more confident speaking up in a chat room.) Chat can be motivating and is an authentic use of language skills, however, preparation and supervision are recommended.</p>
<p>Prepare your children and students:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remind them never to chat with someone they don't know.</li>
<li>Remind them to be courteous and never to use language they wouldn't be comfortable with in their oral communication (for example, it's OK to disagree, but not to be disagreeable).</li>
</ul>
<p>Prepare your chat session:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some teachers prepare questions in advance. They can paste these questions into the Chat session from the Clipboard or Write Activity—this helps them stay on task and keeps the pace of the session lively.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Limit the number of students participating in the Chat session; more that 10–12 participants makes a session chaotic.</li>
<li>Ask your students to prepare by posing questions in advance.</li>
<li>As in any classroom discussion, keep the conversation focused on just one or two topics. </li>
<li>IT IS SOMETIME USEFUL TO USE ALL-CAPS TO GET EVERYONE'S ATTENTION.<br />
</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
<br />

<h1>Advanced features</h1>
<p>Computers not running Sugar can initiate chat connections to a Sugar user by running a Jabber (XMPP) client, either with both computers registered on the same Jabber server or by running a link local XMPP account such as Empathy with salut or Pidgin with Bonjour.</p>
<p>Here's an example of a buddy list on another non-Sugar computer.<br />
</p>
<p>  <img src="static/Sugar-share-chat2-en.png" /></p>
<p>When you initiating the chat on a non-Sugar computer using a Jabber client, an invitation appears on the Sugar computer and the Sugar user can chat with you as usual except that the colors of the non-Sugar participant's response lines are gray as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="static/Sugar-share-chat_3-en.png" title="chat_3" alt="chat_3" width="600" height="75" /></p>
<p>Here's what the non-Sugar computer sees on their Jabber client.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/Sugar-share-chat_marvin-en.png" title="chat_marvin" alt="chat_marvin" width="350" height="418" /></p>
<p>And here's the response as seen on the Sugar computer. <br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/Sugar-share-chat_4-en.png" title="chat_4" alt="chat_4" width="600" height="100" /><br />
</p>
<p><strong>CHAT SAFELY</strong>: Remember, only chat with someone you know. If someone invites you to chat, don't chat with them unless you know them. It's perfectly okay to refuse a chat request.</p>
<h2>Note to parents and teachers</h2>
<p>You can use this feature to chat with Sugar-enabled computers from non-Sugar-enabled computers; hence you can chat with your child or class from a conventional desktop or laptop computer.<br />

<p>For more help with <em>_</em> you can try these avenues:</p>
<h2><span id="ch010_help.xhtml#VideoLan%20Documentation"></span> VideoLan Documentation </h2>
<p>should first look at the very good documentation at the developers site:</p>
<p>link<br />
</p>
<h2><span id="ch010_help.xhtml#Online%20Forums"></span> Online Forums </h2>
<p>You can also try searching through the forums for information.  </p>
<p>link</p>
<p>The forums contain a lot of postings from users on many topics. You can use the search system to locate topics or just browse the categories. If you don't find what you want then try subscribing to the forums and posting your question to the relevant category. There are a few things to keep in mind when asking a question in a forum or to a mailing list. First, be as clear as you can with your question and provide any information that you might think would help some to try to help you. You might, for example, include information about the operating system you are using, or various specifics that relate to what you are trying to achieve. Additionally, it is always good practice to also post back to any forum or mailing list if you manage to solve your query and include clear information on how you solved the puzzle. This is so that someone else that may have the same issue can resolve it using what you have found out. If possible post back to the same thread (discussion topic) so that anyone searching through the forum can follow the discussion including the solution.</p>
<h2><span id="ch010_help.xhtml#Web%20Search"></span> <strong>Web Search</strong></h2>
<p>Searching the web is always useful. If you are looking for problems arising from errors reported by the software then try entering the error text into the search engine. Be sure to edit out any information that doesn't look generic when doing this. Some search engines also enable you to try searches of mailing lists, online groups etc, this can also provide good results.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<h2><span id="ch010_help.xhtml#Mailing%20Lists"></span> Mailing Lists</h2>
<p>Mailing lists are good places to look through for answers to questions. The archives are located here :</p>
<p>link</p>
<p>You can browse the archives (although this can take a while). You can also subscribe to the mailing lists and ask a question:</p>
<p>link</p>
<p>Please note the suggestions about posting to forums and mailing lists in the above section.</p>
<h2><span id="ch010_help.xhtml#IRC"></span> <strong>IRC</strong></h2>
<p><strong>IRC</strong> is a type of online chat. it is not the easiest to use if you are not familiar with it but it is a very good system. There are a variety of softwares for all operating systems that enable you to use <strong>IRC</strong>. The <strong>IRC</strong> channel is where a number of the developers are online and some 'superusers'. So logging into this channel can be useful but it is very important that you know exactly what you are trying to find out before trying this route. The protocol for using the channel is jus tot log in, and ask the question immediately. Don't try and be too chatty as you are probably going to be ignored. It is also preferable if you have done some research using the other methods above before trying the channel. The details for the <strong>IRC</strong> channel are:</p>
<ul>
<li>IRC network: <code>detail</code></li>
<li>Channel: <code>#detail</code><br />

<p>Version 2, June 1991</p>
<p>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br />
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA<br />
<br />
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br />
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Preamble</strong></p>
<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.</p>
<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</p>
<p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</p>
<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>
<p>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.</p>
<p>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.</p>
<p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</p>
<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.</p>
<p><strong>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</strong></p>
<p><strong>0.</strong> This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot; means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</p>
<p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>
<p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<p><br />
</p>
</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>a)</strong> You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<p><br />
</p>
</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>b)</strong> You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<p><br />
</p>

<p><strong>c)</strong> If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p>
<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.</p>
<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<p><br />
</p>
</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>a)</strong> Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<p><br />
</p>
</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>b)</strong> Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<p><br />
</p>
</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>c)</strong> Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.</p>
<p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</p>
<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</p>
<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.</p>
<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong> The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>10.</strong> If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</p>
<p><strong>NO WARRANTY</strong></p>
<p><strong>11.</strong> BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>
<p><strong>12.</strong> IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
<p><strong>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</strong></p>
