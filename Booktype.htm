<h1>What is Booktype?</h1>
<p>With Booktype you can create books. Real paper books that look good and you can hold in your hands. You can also use Booktype to produce books in the form of epub (electronic books), PDF, OpenOffice files, web pages and more...</p>
<p>Booktype is a web based software which means you do not install it on your computer, rather you access it through a browser. Your organisation can install its own copy of Booktype on a server. Access is then made through a url provided by your organisation.<br />
</p>
<p>Once installed Booktype supports any individual or group that wishes to write a book. All you need is a browser. Some typical uses of the platform might be :</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing books - e.g. a fiction, manuals, cookbooks etc.</li>
<li>Producing printed books</li>
<li>Producing ebooks</li>
<li>Writing any content as an individual</li>
<li>Collaboratively authoring content</li>
<li>Rapidly developing content in Book Sprints</li>
<li>Customising existing content to apply to a very specific context</li>
<li>Translating a book into another language</li>
</ul>
<p>Booktype is designed to help you produce books, either by yourself or with others. Booktype is also a social environment where you can also discuss your views about producing books, seek assistance from others, look for projects to contribute to, seek others to help you, translate content and publish completed works.</p>
<p>Booktype supports the rapid development of content. You can use Booktype to develop content in intensive 'Book Sprints'. Book Sprints are intensive collaborative events where 6-10 people focus on writing a book in 3-5 days. These collaborators might be in the same room or located around the net, in either case they work together simultaneously to produce a book rapidly.</p>
<p>While you can use Booktype to support very traditional book authoring processes, Booktype was also developed to facilitate the accelerated production models enabled by Book Sprints. Hence the feature set matches the rapid pace of publishing possible in the modern era of print on demand. Using Booktype, a book can be created in 2-5 days and then print ready source (book formatted PDF) can be generated in another 2-5 minutes, and then uploaded to your favourite print-on-demand service.</p>
<p>Whether you are collaborating, writing in solo, rapidly developing books, or taking your time - when you have worked with Booktype you will never think of publishing the same way again.</p>
<p>Booktype is Free Software. This means that it can be freely downloaded, re-used and customised.</p>
<p><span id="ch002_creating-an-account.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Creating an Account</h1>
<p>After arriving at Booktype you will first need to create a user account before starting on your book!.</p>
<p>Account creation is simple:</p>
<p><img src="static/logoin.png" /> </p>
<ol>
<li>Under <strong>Create Account</strong> add your desired <em>USERNAME</em>, <em>E-MAIL</em>, <em>PASSWORD</em> and then your <em>FULL NAME</em>. Your full name is required as it is used for copyright attribution on any works you create or contribute to.</li>
<li>click <strong>Create account</strong>.</li>
<li>Booktype will generate the account and redirect you to your <strong>Dashboard</strong>.<br />
</li>
</ol>
<p><span id="ch003_my-settings.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>My Dashboard</h1>
<p>Your Dashboard helps you to manage your books and groups. edit a number of settings to customise your appearance on Booktype, and communicate with others. <img src="static/dashboard.png" /></p>
<p>To view your settings visit your Dashboard and click <strong>Settings</strong> on the menu. Here you can edit your email and full name if either of those were typed in incorrectly or if they change in the future.</p>
<p>Below your full name is a text box where you can type in a description about yourself, and at the bottom of the page you can browse your computer for an image to upload for Booktype for use in your profile.</p>
<p>Once you have made the changes you want to your settings click <strong>Save changes</strong>.</p>
<p><span id="ch005_creating-a-book.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Creating a Book</h1>
<p>All books are created from your Dashboard using the Book Wizard.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/cbtab.png" /> </p>
<ol>
<li>Click on <strong>CREATE NEW BOOK</strong></li>
<li>The Book Wizard will open asking for the title of the book. This is the only required information. You can step through the wizard adding the rest of the information or you can simply click 'Create' now.<br />
</li>
<li>Once you press Create you will be redirected to the books Info page.<br />
</li>
<li>You can always access your books from your Dashboard. Your books are listed under the <strong>My Books</strong> tab (on your Dashboard) as well as in the list of <strong>My Books</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Booktype will not let you create two books with the same name.<br />
</p>
<p><span id="ch006_creating-chapters.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Creating Chapters</h1>
<p>Once a new book is created click on the edit button next to the title of the new book on your Dashboard to open the book's editing page. You can also access an edit button from the book info page.</p>
<p><img src="static/editor_new.png" /> </p>
<p>You will see the book open on the Chapters tab. This page is divided into two areas, the top area is the Table of contents and the bottom area is called Hold chapters. Any chapter residing in Hold Chapters will not be included when you publish your book.</p>
<h2>Creating a Chapter</h2>
<ol>
<li>In the Chapters tab on the editing page click on NEW CHAPTER at the top or bottom of the Table of contents.</li>
<li>The New chapter window opens, enter the Title of your new chapter and click Create chapter.</li>
</ol>
<p><span id="ch007_editing-a-chapter.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Editing a Chapter</h1>
<p>Once you have created chapters, content needs to be added to them (text and images). This is probably how you will be spending most of your time in Booktype; writing material, reviewing, editing and updating chapters as well as inserting and organising images.</p>
<h2>Accessing the Chapter Editor</h2>
<ol>
<li>First you need to be in the Editing page for the book you are working on.</li>
<li>Make sure the Table of contents is visible by clicking on the Chapters Tab.</li>
<li>Then click on the EDIT link next to the chapter you want to edit.</li>
<li>The <strong>Chapter editor</strong> opens showing the Chapter Title and any content that has already been added.</li>
<li>Type away!</li>
</ol>
<h2>Saving your Work</h2>
<p>As with every other software application you need to save your work regularly to avoid losing those hours worth of effort due to your laptop battery going flat or some similar incident.</p>
<p>Booktype has three buttons concerning saving your work which are located at the top of the Chapter editor. They are Save, Save and continue editing and Cancel.</p>
<p><strong>Save</strong> : clicking on Save will not only save your changes to the chapter, but will also close the Chapter Editor and return you to the Book's Table of contents.</p>
<p><strong>Save and continue editing</strong> : This button is extremely useful, when it saves your changes it leaves the editor open for you to continue making changes to the chapter. This is the button to use regularly to ensure you don't lose the changes you have made to the chapter.</p>
<p><strong>Cancel</strong> : This button is only used if you decide that you don't want to keep the changes that you have made to the chapter.</p>
<p><span id="ch008_the-table-of-contents.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>The Table of Contents</h1>
<p>Once several chapters have been created and developed, it is time to organise and order your Table of Contents.</p>
<h2>Adding Sections to your Table of Contents</h2>
<p>To add sections to a book:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the editing page click <strong>NEW SECTION</strong> at the top or bottom of the <strong>Table of contents</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>New section</strong> window opens, enter the title of your new section and click <strong>Create section</strong>.</li>
<li>The new section is created and placed at the bottom of the Table of contents.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Organising the Table of Contents</h2>
<p>Inside a book's <strong>Chapters</strong> tab, the page is divided into two areas, the top area is the <strong>Table of contents</strong> and the bottom area is called <strong>Hold chapters</strong>. Any chapter residing in <strong>Hold Chapters</strong> will not be included when you publish your book.</p>
<h3>Re-ordering Sections and Chapters</h3>
<p>If your sections need to be re-ordered <strong>click</strong> and <strong>hold</strong> on the Section or Chapter you wish to move, then <strong>drag</strong> the it up or down to get to it's rightful place. To remove a section or chapter, drag it down into the <strong>Hold chapters</strong> area. Note: Sections dragged to the Hold Area are deleted but Chapters are not deleted.</p>
<h2>Editing Chapter Titles</h2>
<p>Once a chapter or section has been created, you may not always like the title or you might be re-organising the entire book and therefore chapters and sections need to be re-named for the new structure :</p>
<ol>
<li>Open your book's <strong>Edit</strong> page and make sure the <strong>Chapters</strong> tab is selected.</li>
<li><strong>Double-Click</strong> on the chapter or section name that you want to change. A text field opens allowing you to change your title.</li>
<li>Make any changes you desire and then click on the <strong>SAVE</strong> button to the right of the text field. <strong>CANCEL</strong> will of course cancel any changes made and return you to the previous title.</li>
</ol>
<p>To change a Section title you must delete it by dragging it to the Hold Area and add another Section with the correct name.<br />
</p>
<p><span id="ch009_adding-images.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Adding Images</h1>
<p>When you want to add images start editing the chapter you want to add images to, get your cursor in the right place and click the import images button.</p>
<p>When the Insert Image window opens.</p>
<p><img src="static/addimage1.png" /> </p>
<p>Click Browse to add an new image.</p>
<p><img src="static/image_2.png" /><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Browse tab</strong> : The Images tab lists all the images currently uploaded to your book, click on an image name in the list and it will display a preview for you in the panel on the right. If this is the image you want to add to your chapter click Insert.</p>
<p><strong>Upload  tab</strong> : If the image you want to insert is not visible in the Images tab then it still needs to be uploaded to Booktype, it is time for the Upload tab.</p>
<p>From here it is off to the Chose File button, which opens the regular file browsing window for your computer. Find the image you want and click on Open and then Upload.<br />
</p>
<p>You can now insert the image you want into your chapter by selecting it from the list and clicking <strong>Insert</strong>.</p>
<p><span id="ch010_exporting.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Publishing</h1>
<p>Booktype can publish to several channels and output formats. If you do not see the one you want listed then Booktype can be extended to include it since it is an Open Source software.</p>
<p><img src="static/output.png" /> </p>
<p>Lets look at the current formats and channels available :</p>
<p><strong>book formatted pdf - (PDF)</strong> : Used for the creation of printed books, the book (PDF) file can be uploaded to a print on demand service or even sent to a local printer for printing of a standard bound book. It can also be used for printing a single copy of a book from a domestic printer.</p>
<p><strong>screen formatted pdf - (PDF)</strong> : This type of output is a PDF formatted to be read on screen. It can be linked from a webpage, uploaded to various PDF reading sites, or downloaded for reading.</p>
<p><strong>ebook</strong> : a ebook (or e-book) is an electronic book. Booktype generates  many different types of e-books for reading on devices like the Kindle, Nook, Sony Reader and iPad.</p>
<p><strong>OpenOffice Rich Text format (.odt) :</strong> This output is a 'text document' and can be opened and edited in LibreOffice and other word processors.</p>
<p><strong>HTML :</strong> the templated HTML output can be downloaded put online as part of a website.</p>
<p><strong>Lulu.com :</strong> Booktype integrates with Lulu.com so that you can publish direct to this print on demand service. </p>
<h2>Publishing a Book</h2>
<p>Once a book is ready from the Book page, click on the Publish tab. </p>
<p>If you are happy with just the standard Booktype look and feel for your book do the following:   <br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose the output type from the list</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Publish<br />
</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Booktype will create the favoured book type and when finished will display a link to the book.</p>
<p>Booktype enables an incredible amount of power to customise each output format. For more information read the advanced sections of this manual</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><span id="ch012_communicating.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Communication</h1>
<p>When collaborating on a book, communication is a vital part of the process, whether working in a book sprint, taking your time on more long-term book generation, working locally in the same physical space or remotely online. These situations have different requirements and harmonising these into one system is where we have done a lot of real world research and Booktype takes the best of what we have learned. Booktype includes tools such as real time edit notifications to see who is editing what at this moment, a real time chat (web / IRC gateway), system level notifications, chapter status markers, messaging tools, book progress indicators, work flow tools, and live user status listings.</p>
<p><img src="static/collab.png" /></p>
<h2>Real time edit notifications</h2>
<p>When you have clicked on an edit link for a chapter and someone else enters the books Editing screen your user name replaces the EDIT link in the Table of contents. This notification happens in real time, if you are looking at the overview screen when someone else clicks the edit link for one of its chapters you will see the edit button change to their user name.</p>
<h2>Messaging</h2>
<p>It is possible to message other people in Booktype using the messaging services.</p>
<p><img src="static/msg2.png" /> </p>
<p>Messaging works like any short message service (Status.net or Twitter). To message someone enter their @ followed by their username. To message a group use ! followed by the group name. Tags (#) are also supported. It is also possible to follow people, groups and tags.</p>
<p>Messaging in Booktype is not designed to be 'just' for fun (although that is important!) but it is integrated into a collaborative workflow. From the editor is is possible to highlight text and click on the messaging button and that text is copied into the message. That means you can send messages with text snippets, images etc to others for proof reading or checking, translation etc.</p>
<p>Additionally when messaging is used this way an additional 'context URL' is added which is included in the message. Clicking on this directs the recipient to the chapter from which the content was sent. </p>
<h2>Real time chat</h2>
<p>Upon entering a book's Editing page you will see a chat box for that book. The Chat is visible for the duration of the time you are editing the book, regardless of which chapter you are working on. Anyone else editing the book also has the chat box and you are able to communicate with them by typing directly into the text field under the the chat box. This feature is very useful for communication with remote participants in Book Sprints as well as any situation where contributors to a book are working on it simultaneously.</p>
<p>Other information is also communicated through the Chat box. When a contributor enters the book editing screen a JOINED marker is displayed along with their name in the Chat box. So anyone already editing a book can see that someone else has joined them in editing mode and they can start communicating.</p>
<h2>Live Contributor Listing</h2>
<p>Below the chat box is a Currently editing panel which lists all people currently working on the book. </p>
<h2>System level notification</h2>
<p>System Level Notifications are generated when the following actions are performed:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a user saves a chapter</li>
<li>When a user creates a new chapter</li>
<li>When a user renames a chapter</li>
<li>When a user alters the status of a chapter</li>
<li>When a user creates a new section</li>
<li>When a book is being published</li>
<li>When a user saves a book's notes</li>
</ul>
<p>Booki generates and displays the messages in two ways: using the <strong>Chat Box</strong> and using the <strong>History Tab</strong> in the Editing Page.</p>
<h2>Chat Box</h2>
<p>When one of the above actions is performed the Chat box displays an <strong>INFO</strong> marker and brief description outlining what has taken place. This Notification is extremely useful where several participants are collaborating on a book simultaneously. Each participant is kept up to date of others' progress and can instantly reply to any notifications using the Chat Box.</p>
<h2>History Tab</h2>
<p>The <strong>History tab</strong> sits next to the <strong>Chapters tab</strong> in the <strong>Book Editing Page</strong>. Clicking to the History tab loads up a list of all the edits that have been made to the bookEvery time one of the above actions is performed a new item is added to the history tab.</p>
<p>The History Tab is divided into 3 columns: <strong>action</strong>, <strong>user</strong> and <strong>time</strong>. The <strong>action</strong> column lists the type of action that has taken place and if necessary it includes extra detail regarding the action. For example if the action recorded is <strong>create</strong> or <strong>save</strong> then the detail will list the name of the chapter that was created or saved. The <strong>user</strong> column lists the Booki user who has performed the action and the date and time of the action is recorded in the <strong>time</strong> column.</p>
<p>To see more detail a user is able to click on the underlined chapter name in the action column which loads a history page for that particular chapter.</p>
<p>If an edit to a chapter has been very minor, for example a spelling correction, the author has the option to prevent a history record from being generated when the chapter is saved. This is carried out using the <strong>Minor change, don't notify</strong> tick box at the bottom of the <strong>Chapter Editing panel</strong>. Placing a tick in the box will prevent a history record from being generated when the chapter is saved.</p>
<p>An author also has the ability to add comments to the history record using three text boxes below the <strong>Minor change, don't notify</strong> tick box. The top box is a <strong>general comment box</strong>, followed by an <strong>Author</strong> text box, where the Author has the option of entering their name. The final text box is an <strong>Author comment</strong> box where the author is able to make another note. Comments entered into any of these text boxes will be added to a history record when the chapter is saved.</p>
<h2>Chapter History</h2>
<p>The history tab not only lets you see the changes that have happened to the book but it also allows you to view the changes that have happened to individual chapters. Clicking on a chapters name in the action column takes you to a chapter history display. Here you will see a list of all the edits made to a chapter from it's first creation down to the most recent revision. The Chapter History lists the <strong>revision</strong> numbers with the most recent revision at the top, it also includes the <strong>user</strong> who edited each revision, the <strong>time and date</strong> the revision was saved and also any <strong>comments</strong> made by the author in the <strong>general comment box</strong> mentioned above.</p>
<p>Using the <strong>compare</strong> column on the left you can review the differences between any two revisions. Simply select the left radio button for one chapter and the right radio button for the other chapter you want to compare, then click on the <strong>Compare revisions</strong> button to see the differences between the two chapters.</p>
<p>The records in the history tab can be very useful for working on a book over a long period of time where contributing authors are often not logged into Booki at the same time. It can display what edits other authors have contributed since the last time a participant logged on and help them to decide what areas to work on. This is especially true if the author has added comments detailing what they did and what further work they feel is needed in order to complete the chapter they have contributed to.</p>
<h2>Chapter status markers</h2>
<p>In the Chapters tab of the book editing page, on the right hand side of each chapter bar there is a <strong>status marker</strong> for the chapter.</p>
<p>This can be manually altered depending on what stage the chapter is up to. Clicking on the marker reveals a drop-down list. Click on the list and select the status required for the chapter. The chapter's marker is changed to the new status.</p>
<p>When working on a book that has been created from scratch, the default marker is <strong>not published</strong>. For a book that has been imported from another source, the default status for a chapter is <strong>imported</strong> even for new chapters that have been created from scratch after the import.</p>
<h2>Book Notes</h2>
<p>A books notes are where contributors can discuss and add comments about the book as a whole. Anything can be added to a book's notes including a suggested structure or outline for a book, which areas need urgent attention and even suggestions for a books direction. Book Notes are accessed through the Notes tab on the Book Editing Page. Once there you have a free text field to add a much or as little as you want. When you have added your notes, click Save the notes at the bottom of the Notes tab to save your changes, an INFO notification will be displayed in the Chat box saying that the notes have been saved.</p>
<p><span id="ch014_creating-a-group.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Creating a Group</h1>
<p>Sometimes the group you want to join isn't there yet, so this is your opportunity to blaze a trail and start up a group of your very own.</p>
<ol>
<li>Visit your Dashboard. Once the page loads you will see the <strong>CREATE NEW GROUP</strong> button. Click on this.<br />

<li>Now click <strong>ADD THIS BOOK TO GROUP</strong>. Your book now appears under the Books list on the Group page.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Removing a Book from a Group</h2>
<p>At some point you may want to remove a book from a group. On the group's page under the <strong>Books</strong> tab you will see a <strong>remove</strong> link next to your book. Click on the link and your book will disappear from the list.</p>
<p><span id="ch018_formless-content.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Formless Content</h1>
<p>There is a lot of interesting stuff happening to the page right now. The page is changing in so many ways – time based media is making its way into book pages, reactive content, scrollable space, and a multitude of differing display devices make designing pages pretty hard work these days. How to design for so many possibilities? How to understand so many possibilities?</p>
<p>Craig Mod of <a href="http://flipboard.com/">flipboard</a> makes a very compelling argument for two forms of page : formless and definite content in an article he wrote for <a href="http://book.pressbooks.com/chapter/2-book-design-in-the-digital-age-craig-mod">Book: A Futurists Manifesto</a> - the first book to be produced by PressBooks. Craigs argument in a nutshell and in his own words is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the<strong> key difference</strong> between Formless and Definite Content is the interaction between the content and the page. Formless Content doesn’t see the page or its boundaries; Definite Content is not only aware of the page, but embraces it. It edits, shifts, and resizes itself to fit the page [...] Put very simply, Formless Content is unaware of the container. Definite Content embraces the container as a canvas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Craig argues that most book content we know is formless – the text can reflow into other containers without effecting the meaning.  Its a really well argued position and one that is in tension to the current design methodologies of book designers today. Book designers are taught to design contained space – books are a very definite context in which they work. Desktop Publishing Applications are built to meet this methodology. Pixel perfect manipulation within a strictly contained space. If the designed digital article does not exactly match the printed artefact then something went wrong. A lot of energy has gone into this process.</p>
<p>Formless design principles are uneasy to consider for traditional book designers – how can you design for a page that does not yet know its container? It is literally like asking a book designer to design a book without telling them the page dimensions.</p>
<p>As it happens web designers have been thinking about page design too. For a long time now web designers have made pages that embrace differing containers – they have been working, at least in part, with formless content.</p>
<p>What is missing however are good tools for taking the web designers aptitude for working with formless content to enable them to produce books. A good tool set for designing formless books should not work with a constrained page dimensions. It is tempting, for example, to think of working with a design environment with constrained page-like artefacts - think of Google Docs as an example. Could something like Google Docs with its digital, scrollable, yet fixed page size be a good starting point for some kind of design tool? Place layout and typographical controls on top of Google Docs and do we have the next book design environment?</p>
<p>I don’t think so because it is exactly the kind of idea that is blinded by the media of the past and cannot accept that things have changed. We must design tools that enable book design for formless content. What those tools look like is a very interesting question and one which Aleksandar Erkalovic (Booktype lead dev) and I have been working on with students (Hannes Bernard and Aiwen Yin) from the Sandberg Institute in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>Our argument is that the design of formless content is really a partially constrained environment since elements within the page have some kind of relationship to each other. This is an argument web designers are familiar with when using design tools like position:relative – a rule which sets a relative position relationships between objects. Relationships can be constrained or shaped by rules which will be at least partially preserved when displayed in different contexts. The meaning is preserved by the relationship between the elements more than by their relationship to the constraints of a page.</p>
<p>This is the reasoning behind Cascading Style Sheets – the design language of the web. It is rule based design and even partly conditional. It is possible to express conditions in CSS even though it is not done that often. A CSS rule such as :</p>
<pre><code>h2+p {page-break-inside:avoid;}</code></pre>
<p>is a conditional CSS rule which will apply the style only when a paragraph follows heading 2 (h2) element.</p>
<p>Web designers know this kind of thinking but book designers are going to have to let go of pixel perfect design and enjoy thinking and designing this way. It seems like a simple idea but it takes a lot to overcome legacy. The legacy is so strong that designers are pretending the issue does not exist. There are tools now appearing and sold as design environments for iPad books. They give near 1:1 page relationship between design environment and the final result. However we all know what happens to digital hardware – it changes. What is true now will not be true 5 years from now so the idea that an ebook is a contained space is very appealing to traditional book designers but it will be a short lived myth. iPads might keep the same form for 5 years, they might not but they certainly will not keep it over the next 5-10 years. Better to learn how to design in the new way than be fooled into thinking you can bring all the old methods to a new medium and get away with it for long.</p>
<p>Booktype works with formless content and design using CSS. We are working on a visual design environment to assist this process but for now CSS is added through the Settings in the Publish tab. Almost any CSS that you make yourself or find on the net can be applied to the books. </p>
<p><span id="ch019_css.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Adding CSS</h1>
<p>So, all outputs are controlled by CSS. That is because we use the Webkit browsing engine to render our PDF with a few bells an whistles. Rule based design is something people have to get used to however for contained page design so I thoroughly recommend you experiment lots with this side of the production. We have not explored this enough as the potential far outreaches our resources.<br />
<br />
There are two parts to the CSS. The first is the usual styling of elements that you are probably familiar with from WWW design. Since we use Webkit (which is the browsing engine behind Safari and Chrome) just about any CSS you can apply to a webpage can be applied to elements in a book and in the same way.</p>
<p>To apply H1 use syntax like:</p>
<pre><code>h1 { font-weight:bold;}</code></pre>
<p>You can additionally use webfonts with @font-face but these will not be rendered in a paper book because PDF requires the fonts to be embedded. So the fonts must e stored on the server.<br />
<br />
All CSS can be entered into the Wizard in the Publish tab for any edit page (_edit) for any book. Each book has its own settings per user per book per format. So anything you try will not effect other users settings etc. The wizard can be opened by clicking on &quot;Settings&quot; and then you will see some options. Choose 'Settings' next to 'book' to format book formatted PDF with CSS. The most interesting screen for custom CSS is the last one - click on 'advanced - style sheets'.</p>
<p><img src="static/publish.png" /></p>
<p>You will see two boxes.</p>
<p> <img src="static/css.png" /></p>
<p>Enter the CSS into the first box and make sure you select &quot;Override ALL previous settings with custom CSS&quot;. Then try adding CSS, submitting the Wizard and click &quot;Publish this book&quot; to see the results.</p>
<p><span id="ch020_book-design-with-css.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Learn by Sharing</h1>
<div class="entry">
<p>To understand the relationship between CSS and the final result there is no substitute for trial and error. Designers must first understand how a ‘web native’ technology — CSS — applies to page based media (books). This paradigm appears simple but it requires a slight re-alignment of how book designers think about designing books, and to do this designers must try the process and persevere until they succeed. After that initial success things become easier.</p>
<p>Probably the best way to start is to take an existing book and look at someone elses CSS, then change it and see what happens. Generating a PDF takes anywhere from half a minute to a few minutes so this is a pretty quick method for seeing how CSS effects the layout of the book. For experimenting visit the following page:</p>
<p>http://collaborative-futures.org/</p>
<p>At the bottom of this page you will find a link to the CSS used for the print version of the second edition of this book — its the same book you are currently working on. You can see the CSS states:</p>
<pre><code>/* Main CSS File: */
@import url(&quot;http://collaborative-futures.org/material/styles.css&quot;);</code></pre>
<pre><code>/* Uncomment based on the book size you export: */</code></pre>
<pre><code>/* A5 */
/* @import url(&quot;http://collaborative-futures.org/material/size/a5-hacks.css&quot;); */</code></pre>
<pre><code>/* 5.5&quot;x8.5&quot; */
/* @import url(&quot;http://collaborative-futures.org/material/size/5.5x8.5-hacks.css&quot;);*/</code></pre>
<p>This is CSS syntax that imports the ‘real’ CSS used which can be found here:</p>
<p>http://collaborative-futures.org/material/styles.css</p>
<p>Copy this CSS, change it, and enter it in the CSS text field of Booktype then try exporting the book again. Experiment with changing the CSS and see what happens..</p>
<p>The following are some examples you may wish to try out. </p>

<p>There are other examples to be found online, probably the most comprehensive resource is <a href="http://blog.booki.cc">blog.booki.cc</a>. When it comes your turn to create CSS for your own books I strongly recommend you share the CSS online so others can learn from you. </p>
</div>
<p><span id="ch021_table-of-contents-style.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Table of Contents Style</h1>
<p>You can also change the style of the Table of Contents at the front of the book. To do this you must open the Advanced CSS panel and look at the <span>Booktype CSS field:</span></p>
<p><img src="static/booktype_css.png" /> </p>
<p>Here you can find a lot of CSS that defines some advanced items including the Table of Contents. If you scroll down this window you will find the ToC CSS:</p>
<pre><code> /* TOC ******************************/
table {
  float: none;
}

table.toc {
  font-size: 1.1em;
  width: 95%;
}

table.toc td{
  vertical-align:top
  padding-left: 0.5em;
}

td.chapter {
  padding: 0 0.5em;
  text-align: right;
}

table.toc td.pagenumber {
  text-align: right;
  vertical-align:bottom;
}

td.section {
  padding-top: 1.1em;
  font-weight: bold;
}
/* End TOC **************************/</code></pre>
<p>You can change any element here and it will have an effect on the look and feel of the Table of Contents.<br />
</p>
<p><span id="ch022_sections.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Sections</h1>
<p>Books in Booktype are separated into sections and chapters. A section is a collection of chapters. Sections have a page in the book formatted PDF which lists the chapters in that section. It is possible to hide these section pages and change the look and feel of them with CSS.</p>
<p>This can be done on a specific or universal level. To change the look and feel universally you need to change the following elements in the Booktype Only CSS field:</p>
<pre><code> .objavi-subsection{
  display: block;
  page-break-before: always;
/* page-break-after: always;*/
  text-transform: uppercase;
  font-size: 20pt;
}

body .objavi-subsection:first-child{
  page-break-before: avoid;
}

.objavi-subsection .initial {
  font-size: 1em;
  color: #000;
}

.objavi-subsection-heading {
  font-size: 20pt;
  text-align: center;
  line-height: 300px;
  font-weight: normal;
}</code></pre>
<p><span>If you wish to change each section individually you need to target each section with specific CSS. For example the following:</span></p>
<pre><code>#section-1 .objavi-subsection-heading{
 background:#fff url(http://www.freedomfone.org/booki/images/01_whatisff.png) no-repeat  center center;
}</code></pre>
<div>
<p>Will give the first section page an image. You will also need to hide the text in this case so apply this:</p>
<pre><code>.objavi-subsection .initial {
 color: #000;
 display:none;
} </code></pre>
</div>
<p>You have to be a little careful to make sure that each section gets the right image if you try this approach but since it doesn't take long to change the code and test then its easy to fix if you get it wrong.</p>
<p><span id="ch023_front-page.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Front Page</h1>
<p>The style of the front page text (which just displays the title of the book) can be altered with the following CSS (found in Booktype ONLY CSS panel):</p>
<pre><code> h1.frontpage{
  page-break-after:always;
  margin-top:70%;
  font-size: 20pt;
  text-align: center;
  page-break-before: avoid;
  font-weight: normal;
} </code></pre>
<p>You can add additional text such as a byline wiht the following:</p>
<pre><code>h1.frontpage:after
{
content:&quot;by Joe Smog&quot;;
}</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<p><span id="ch024_footers.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Footers</h1>
<p>Footers can be styled with the following code for example (also found in the Booktype only CSS Panel):</p>
<pre><code> #right-footer {
  text-align: right;
}

#left-footer {
  text-align: left;
}   </code></pre>
<p><span id="ch025_some-tricks.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Some tricks</h1>
<p>They are many tricks to working with CSS and some tricks specific to books.</p>
<p>The best thing to know is that you can actually test all of the tricks out on a local machine with a browset and see the results. If you publish a book with Booktype you will get a link to the rendered PDF which looks something like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://objavi.booki.cc/books/awebpageisabook-en-2012.03.25-05.56.42.pdf" class="uri">http://objavi.booki.cc/books/awebpageisabook-en-2012.03.25-05.56.42.pdf</a></p>
<p>This gives you some interesting information that you may not yet know about! Copy and paste the URL of your book, cut off everything after <a href="http://objavi.booki.cc">&quot;objavi.booki.cc&quot;</a> and replace it with /tmp/ eg:</p>
<p>http:objavi.booki.cc/tmp/</p>
<p>You will see a list of directories with books.  Search for your book (use ctrl-f and search for the last part of the url without the suffix, eg search for awebpageisabook-en-2012.03.25-05.56.42). You will fond a directory which you can open and you will see contents like this:</p>
<p><img src="static/sourcedir.png" /> </p>
<p>If you download the body.html and the static directory you will be able to change the CSS files and see the results in your browser. Body.html contains all the information for your book including sections but not the Table of Contents (this is added later). When you edit the CSS and get the version you want you can cut and paste this into your Booktype Advanced CSS window.</p>
<h2>What if My CSS Doesn't show up?</h2>
<p>Sometimes you apply a CSS rule and you do not see any change. There are two tricks for dealing with this. First use the CSS '!important' rule. This is an override rule which can be applied to any CSS rule and will force that rule to take precedence. Take for example the following:</p>
<pre><code> h1{
        font-family:Georgia,serif ! important;
}</code></pre>
<p> This will override any conflicting rules for h1. </p>
<p>The other trick to checking CSS for your book design is to open the body.html file as described above, change the CSS as needed and then install a dynamic CSS console like Firebug. This is a tricky procedure so you might need help finding someone to walk you through this process but essentially these softwares are installed 'into' your browser and they allow you to inspect and change CSS rules dynamically.</p>
<h2>Conditional Rules</h2>
<p>It is not very well known but CSS has some conditional rules. You can use the '+' symbol to combine elements and apply rules only when these two elements appear together. For example you cna do this:</p>
<pre><code>h2+p {font-style:italic;} </code></pre>
<p>This will give the first paragraph after any h1 heading an italic style.  </p>
<h2>Psuedo Elements </h2>
<p>There are many elements that can be targeted in some special ways - like the first letter in a paragraph for example. These are known as 'psuedo elements' in CSS jargon. For example you could target the first letter of all paragraphs like this:</p>
<pre><code>p:first-letter {
font-size: 3.5em;
line-height: 1em;
font-weight: 400;
float: left;
margin: 0 0.107em 0 0;
}</code></pre>
<p>That effectively creates a 'drop cap' effect for paragraphs. If you wanted this to only be applied to the first paragraph of every page you would use a conditional statement like the following:</p>
<pre><code>h2+p:first-letter {
font-size: 3.5em;
line-height: 1em;
font-weight: 400;
float: left;
margin: 0 0.107em 0 0;
}</code></pre>
<p>Pseudo elements exist for many interesting cases including lang, first line, after and others. For a full list of psuedo elements check the W3C website: <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_pseudo_elements.asp" class="uri">http://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_pseudo_elements.asp</a> </p>
<h2>Webkit</h2>
<p>The important thing to know is that Booktype uses Webkit to make PDF. That means any CSS tricks that Chrome or Safari can do, Booktype can do. </p>
<p><span id="ch027_importing-a-book.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Importing a Book</h1>
<p>Books can be imported from several sources, <strong>Archive.org</strong>, <strong>Booktype</strong> and <strong>epub</strong> files. In this chapter we go through each of these scenarios.</p>
<p>To import a book visit your Dashboard and click on the My Books tab. Click on the Import Book button.</p>
<p>A pop-up box will appear with import options:</p>
<p><img src="static/import.png" /> </p>
<p>Choose the desired import type and enter the appropriate ID or URL as described. </p>
<p><em><strong>Note</strong>:</em> <em>When importing text into Booktype from it's respective locations and formats it is important to note that the document structure may not be a part of the source file. This would leave the entire text in a single chapter which will need to be broken up into its individual chapters and Sections once in Booki.</em></p>
<h2>Archive.org</h2>
<p><img src="static/ImportingABook-0100-InternetArchive.png" /></p>
<p>The <strong>Internet Archive</strong> <a href="http://www.archive.org">(http://www.archive.org)</a> is a non-profit digital library storing digitised collections of websites, music, moving images, software and <em>books</em>. With its stated mission of &quot;<em>universal access to all knowledge</em>.&quot;, its purposes include offering permanent access for researchers, historians, scholars, people with disabilities, and the general public to historical collections that exist in digital format.</p>
<p>On your <strong>My Books</strong> tab click on <strong>Import Book</strong> <strong>and</strong> select <strong>Import Archive.org book</strong> from the drop-down list, enter the <strong>Archive.org ID</strong> and press <strong>Import</strong>. The Archive id can be found in the <strong>Identifier</strong> field under the <strong>Selected metadata</strong> section at the bottom of the text's page on Archive.org.</p>
<p>Once the process has finished the imported book will be added to the list of books on your <strong>My Books</strong> page and <strong>Dashboard</strong>.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<h2>ePub</h2>
<p><img src="static/Epub-logo-color-book.png" />ePub, short for Electronic Publication is an open standard e-book format, that has the ability to optimise the text display for whichever device is viewing the book. ePub documents can be read by several different devices, including the Kindle, iPhone, iPad and any Computer with ePub reading Software installed. Booki has the ability to import any document in ePub format.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: although ePub is an open format, not all books available in ePub format have open licences. Therefore, care needs to be taken when choosing to import an ePub document to ensure that it contains a permissive copyright.</p>
<ul>
<li>Project Gutenberg <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">(http://www.gutenberg.org/)</a> is a good place to start looking for openly licensed books in ePub format. It is an organisation dedicated to making books freely available in forms the vast majority of users, hardware and software can easily read, use, quote and search. <img src="static/ImportingABook-0350-ProjectGutenberg.png" /></li>
</ul>
<p>To import an ePub document, first you need to get the url for the ePub book, then copy it's location. Then on your <strong>My Books</strong> tab click on <strong>Import Book</strong> select <strong>Import epub</strong> from the drop-down list. Paste the ePub URL into the <strong>enter epub URL</strong> text box and click on <strong>Import</strong>.</p>
<p>Once the process has finished the imported book will be added to the list of books on your <strong>My Books</strong> and <strong>Dashboard</strong>.</p>
<h2>Import Booktype Book</h2>
<p>It is possible to import books from other Booktype installations. Using this process you can also clone or copy entire books from the same Booktype installation - the process is the same. First you need to get the url for the book, then copy it's location. Then on your <strong>My Books</strong> tab click on <strong>Import Book</strong> select <strong>Copy or import Booktype book</strong> from the drop-down list. Paste the URL into the text box and click <strong>Import</strong>.</p>
<p>Once the process has finished the imported book will be added to the list of books on your <strong>My Books</strong> and <strong>Dashboard</strong>.</p>

<h1>Command Line</h1>
<p>This is some brief infomraiton on how to use the command line admin tools for booktype. Usingthese tools you can export and import books and change the URLS and titles of books</p>
<p>You can do a lot of damage with this, so be careful.<br />
</p>
<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>  django-admin.py help brokenlinks<br />

   django-admin.py bookrename --owner aerkalov command-line</p>
<h2> notes</h2>
<ol>
<li> there is env.sh script in the root. you should read that with &quot;./env.sh&quot; before doing any work from the command line, and especially if trying to run any django management command. you should set it up (it sets pythonpath, path and some other things). when running django app, all this things are loaded trough wsgi script, but when using command line you should load it manually (or put it in your profile, and have it loaded every time. but this is not very smart). this is also place where you setup your DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable.</li>
<li>never run anything as root, or god forbid as your user account (or have things installed in your personal /home directory). if booki is installed to be run as www-data user trough apache, then everything must be run as that user. if you use root account, it will work, but it will also screw file permissions on your log files, on your attachment files and etc. also, running things with super user privilege is not very smart. if you go to booki directory and you see more then one user in &quot;ls -l&quot; result list, you are doing it wrong.</li>
<li>3. django-admin.py and manage.py is result of not having defined DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE variable (and not having django/bin in your path). if you know what you are doing and what manage.py file you are running, it is ok to use it, but it is much smarter to be 100% sure with DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE  and django-admin.py. if you have more then 2 installations on the same machine, DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE is sane way to work with them. and etc..etc...etc... </li>
