<h1>Our story</h1>
<p>Freedom Fone was conceived by Kubatana. Founded in 2001, the Kubatana Trust of Zimbabwe seeks alternative ways to inform and engage civil society in Zimbabwe; it aims to inspire positive social change by sharing information and ideas via Internet, email, mobile phones and print publications.</p>
<p>In Zimbabwe, freedoms of association and expression are regularly repressed. The political and economic struggles over the last decade created a need to engage with audiences situated on the margins of the information society. By taking advantage of both text and voice functions, Freedom Fone provides a means to reach communities that do not have access to other media and remain under-heard because of literacy and language barriers.</p>
<p>While internet in Zimbabwe has become more accessible, it is still available only to a minority, urban-based audience. Mobile phone usage on the other hand has grown exponentially with over 50% of the population - including many who live out in remote rural areas - currently subscribed to mobile networks.</p>
<p>Freedom Fone has proved to be a practical communications tool for small to medium sized organisations working in a number of different sectors from community radio, agricultural development, education or health programmes, to elections monitoring or emergency relief operations. Freedom Fone makes it easy to interact on an information-on-demand basis with offline audiences that speak multiple languages and may struggle to read or write.</p>
<h2>Your story</h2>
<p>This book was written by our community to help you identify how Freedom Fone can help you and how to implement it to meet your needs.</p>
<p>To help you understand how Freedom Fone could help you, have a look at these sections - <em>Real World Examples</em> features documentation of Freedom Fone in action and <em>Other Possible Scenarios</em> includes some hypothetical examples written by people working in those sectors.</p>
<p>If you have an idea about how Freedom Fone could help you or a new and exciting way to use it we would love to help you bring this to fruition! Feel free to contact the team via email at info@freedomfone.org or call us on +2634776056</p>

<h1>What does Freedom Fone do?</h1>
<p>Freedom Fone allows anyone with a phone to access or contribute information on a specific issue 24 hours a day and seven days a week. It takes advantage of audio and text to address language and literacy barriers when reaching out to marginalised audiences that don't have access to other media. No internet access is required by either you or your audience for this.</p>
<p>Freedom Fone uses interactive voice menus to deliver information to and record information from a caller. You will be familiar with this kind of menu already: &quot;press 1 to access your account, press 2 to speak to a representative, press 3 to record a message...&quot;. We all sometimes have to deal with this kind of system when we dial a number to top up the credit on our mobile phone account, or to talk to a support person, etc.</p>
<p>Freedom Fone enables you to design your own interactive menus to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Share audio information with your audience</strong>; this audio information can take many forms including voice menu (press 1, press 2, etc.), educational dramas, short news items, or even a song!</li>
<li><strong>Organise a poll</strong> to enable your audience to vote on an issue using their phone;</li>
<li><strong>Collect SMSs from your audience</strong> - these might be updates about specific news events, alerts or similar time critical information;</li>
<li><strong>Get your audience to leave audio messages</strong> to share their opinion on a particular topic or make reports in their own language.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are no geographical limitations to Freedom Fone. In fact it can be used and deployed in all countries where there is mobile network coverage, and content can be recorded in any language - even multiple languages, simultaneously.</p>
<p>In addition to ordinary mobile phones, your callers can use landlines and internet-based phones to access the service. This means that Freedom Fone can receive and deliver crucial information via mobile phones or landlines in situations facing power constraints or where the Internet access is limited or interrupted.</p>
<p>Freedom Fone provides an installer that automates much of the setup, empowering a non-technical user to independently set up a sophisticated telephony server in under 30mins.</p>
<p>Once you're set up, an easy graphical user interface lets you control everything you want to do through a simple <em>'dashboard'</em>.</p>
<p><em>Please note: Freedom Fone also has some security features but please be aware that all phones and telephony services have security issues. We have provided chapters in this book that cover this issue from different perspectives. If security is an issue for you or your callers please read this material.</em></p>
<p><span id="ch004_equal-access.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Equal Access</h1>
<p>Equal Access <a href="http://www.equalaccess.org">(www.equalaccess.org)</a> works with marginalised populations through the use of innovative technology to create positive social change. They are using diverse communications strategies to inspire communities to promote economic development, human rights, womens' empowerment, youth engagement and encourage positive action.</p>
<p>Equal Access has been using Freedom Fone in Cambodia and Niger <strong></strong> since 2010. Both countries share extremely low levels of Internet penetration. Although Equal Access uses a combination of traditional broadcast and new media technologies for their programmes, mobile phones have proven to be the best way to engage marginalised audiences.</p>
<p>The programme &quot;<em>Our Community Voice: Many Voices, One Community</em>&quot; in Cambodia covers topics relevant to the youth; in Niger, Freedom Fone is used to support a religious programme covering the issues of extremism and religious conflicts, promoting peaceful dialogue and tolerance.</p>
<p>Graham Gardner, programme manager for Equal Access, was particularly interested to apply the voice functions in Freedom Fone as a way to interact with audiences who may struggle with text-based mobile technology such as SMS.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Mobile phones are increasingly used throughout all of these countries but literacy is a problem in places like Niger and Chad. Even in Cambodia, about 20 to 30% of people cannot read. But a bigger problem here is the fact that Cambodia uses a non-latin script which is not so widely used in technological formats,&quot;</em> explains Gardner.</p>
<p>Although there are mobile phones available that allow audiences to produce text messages in Khymer script, they are not widely used. Even for literate Cambodians, many don't know how to read an English or phonetic Khymer message using latin script.</p>
<p>The <em>Voice Menu</em> functions in Freedom Fone allow Equal Access to be a lot more inclusive with their mobile programmes. <em>&quot;Our Nigerien staff described it as somewhat discriminatory that we only had SMS available to users. So once we brought our Freedom Fone system online, we were being more inclusive in terms of allowing those audiences that wanted to share their comments to call our line and <strong></strong> leave a voice message rather than having to write in text.</em>&quot;</p>
<p>The Cambodian programme received over 4,000 calls in 6 months out of which 50% left a message. Same success in Niger, where 60% of the 2,000 calls ended with a message left. The agreement Equal Access concluded with the mobile operator Orange in Niger for a toll free number, hence tackling the issue of call cost, had an immediate impact on the frequency of calls.</p>
<p>Equal Access makes the most of the <strong></strong> 2-way communication with their audiences made possible by Freedom Fone: they use it to gather feedback and build a community commentary: &quot;<em>People thoroughly enjoyed it when we updated the system with other callers' comments. These community comments would start conversation.</em> &quot;</p>
<p>Freedom Fone is also used to help test the impact of a message and the effectiveness of a campaign. The way audiences react helps them inform their content. <em>&quot;This is a way of educating the audiences about the topics we are covering but also to creating an interactive feedback whereby we are providing an audience with information and they in return are providing us with new ideas, commentary and general questions about our programmes. This is then fed into the production of future content so it creates a cycle or loop.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Freedom Fone offers easily accessible call data records, monitoring and reporting functions that provide a treasure trove of information to help gauge the relevance and actual value of any programme and how communities are receiving and interacting with a particular service.</p>
<p><em>&quot;For us it's really all about creating a connection with the audience, creating interaction between our work, the work of our partners and the people we are trying to serve. It is also about shared learning for us and any tool that allows us to do that is a good one so we will absolutely continue to use Freedom Fone.&quot;</em></p>

<h1>Farm Radio International</h1>
<p>Farm Radio International (<a href="http://www.farmradio.org/" title="Farm Radio International website">www.farmradio.org</a>) is a Canadian-based, non-profit organisation, that assists small scale farmers in Africa with food security. Farm Radio works with over 290 partner radio stations across Africa to train broadcasters, create radio scripts and conduct educational radio campaigns on agricultural topics that can improve the livelihoods of farmers.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>...there are a few shortcomings of radio: if you miss the show, you miss the info; with radio it is not possible to make information available on demand. Radio also lacks a reliable channel for interacting with listeners. This is a pitfall for Farm Radio because although radio is the primary 'media' source of information for farmers, we know that their favourite source is their peers - other farmers!</em>&quot;<br />
-- Bart Sullivan, ICT and Radio Specialist at Farm Radio International</p>
<p>Since January 2010, Farm Radio has been using Freedom Fone to increase the impact of their educational radio programmes and involve more farmers' voices.</p>
<h2>The Kuku Hotline, Tanzania</h2>
<p>Early in 2010, Radio Maria in Tanzania conducted a campaign <strong></strong> on best practices for small scale poultry farming. One specific objective was to help decrease chicken death rates from 60% to 20% with simple, low-cost, very practical advice.</p>
<p>In partnership with Radio Maria, Farm Radio decided to hold a competition to assess how the poultry farmers of the area had been impacted by the campaign. The competition was set up using Freedom Fone's <em>Leave-a-Message (LAM)</em> function and was advertised on-air through a series of radio jingles.</p>
<p>Farmers were invited to call in and comment on the impact of the campaign and asked what they intended to do to improve their farming practices. Awards to winners were 20 colourful Kuku Hotline T-shirts.</p>
<p>&quot;First, I plan to build a proper house for my chickens to keep them safe and care for them - the money I get from their eggs, I will use to improve my business. Secondly, I will open a bank account to save money for my children's school fees. Thanks to the Kuku Hotline, thank you&quot;</p>
<p><em>--</em> Neema Mbise, One of the winners, Chicken Farmer in Morogoro, Tanzania</p>
<p>The service received over 1,400 calls in one month. On the final two broadcasts of the campaign, the 20 winning messages were broadcasted on Radio Maria.</p>
<p>The Kuku Hotline became popular because it included the actual voices of farmers on the radio. This encouraged Radio Maria and Farm Radio International to use Freedom Fone to make radio more interactive and create more participatory radio campaigns.</p>
<h2><em>Farmers Phone,</em> Ghana</h2>
<p>In Ghana, the <em>Voice Menu</em> <strong></strong> function of Freedom Fone was used to share a variety of agricultural information with farmers in two local languages: Akan and Ewe. The farmer could select from a variety of menu choices:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&quot;To listen to market prices press 1&quot;</em> which would give the farmer updated market prices for the top 3 commodities from 3 local markets in the Volta Region;</li>
<li><em>&quot;For a summary of last week's radio program press 2&quot;</em> would allow the farmer to hear a summary of the previous week's broadcast;</li>
<li><em>&quot;To leave a message for the radio presenters press 3&quot;</em> would give the farmer a chance to ask a question or leave a message for the programme.</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;<em>By providing farmers with up to date market prices they can make informed decisions. For example, once I know that my sweet potatoes would sell for 1.2 dollars/kg in the Abotoasi market and 1.4 dollars/kg at Akatsi market, which is 20 km further from my home, I can decide whether it is worth arranging transport to go the extra mile to Akatsi or not - it might still be too far away!</em>&quot; says Sullivan.</p>
<p>Between January and April 2010, the service received over 4,500 calls. There was a group of about 50 farmers who used the service consistently from week to week and it would take them about two minutes to get the market price information they wanted before ending the call.</p>
<p>Most calls were received before 6 am in the morning, when calls are cheaper. Although call costs remain a challenge, farmers still used the service because they were getting actual value from the information provided.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>We provided farmers with information that was really making a difference to them. And the radio stations we partnered with naturally had the skills and equipment for audio scripting, recording and editing. For them, using Freedom Fone proved very easy,</em>&quot; explains Sullivan.</p>
<p>Today, Farm Radio International continues to use Freedom Fone for agriculture related information and have extended their reach to Mali. Opportunities in Uganda and Malawi are also under consideration.</p>

<h1>LIRNEasia Crisis Response<br />
</h1>
<p>LIRNEasia (<a href="http://www.lirneasia.net/">www.lirneasia.net)</a> are a regional information and communication technology (ICT) think tank active across the Asia Pacific. They began working together with one of Sri Lanka's biggest NGO's, Sarvodaya (<a href="http://www.sarvodaya.org/">www.sarvodaya.org)</a> in June 2011 to use Freedom Fone in emergency response operations.</p>
<p>Whether during a flood, earthquake or tsunami, governments or emergency services usually have a very short time to send out a warning alert to a large and diverse population around the affected area. In such situations, the rapidity of response and accuracy of the information provided by any disaster management system is of the essence. This creates a great need for voice based communications to complement an initial SMS text alert.</p>
<p><em>&quot;The character limitation of SMS limits the amount of information we can send when alerting the first responders in an emergency. If we could deliver a short wake-up text message and a localised descriptive voice message, that would be much more effective. That's where we found Freedom Fone very useful.</em>&quot;<br />
-- Nuwan Waidanyatha, research fellow at LIRNEasia</p>
<p>Sarvodaya plans to combine <em>SMS</em> alerts (sent using Sahana or other bulk SMS applications) with Freedom Fone's <em>Voice Menus</em> function to share important updates with villagers. SMS alerts will be sent to a network of trained individuals in each village - known as first responders - with an additional request to phone Sarvodaya's Freedom Fone lines for more detailed information about the evolving crisis.</p>
<p>Feedback, situation reports and requests for information and help from the field will be facilitated through the <em>Leave-a-Message</em> function, as Nuwan Waidanyatha describes further:</p>
<p><em>&quot;When Sarvodaya first-responders assess the damage and report the incidents for rescue and relief actions they call Freedom Fone to leave a message. For example, several students evading the flood waters are stranded on a building and need immediate assistance. This message is received at the Sarvodaya incident command center and is processed to deploy the required resources.&quot;</em></p>
<p>When Freedom Fone's <em>Campaign Dialer</em> function is released in late 2011, it will be possible to automate <em>call-outs</em> to the list of numbers in a Freedom Fone <strong></strong> <em>Phone Book</em>. When recipients answer their phone, they will be connected to a <em>Voice Menu</em> with updated information about the crisis. This feature can make sure people are alerted and informed of a crisis in the event that first responders fail to receive the initial SMS alerts.</p>
<p><img src="static/lirneasia.png" /><br />
</p>
<p>Sarvodaya's Emergency Response Team field tested Freedom Fone in a number of different districts in Sri Lanka. They found that Freedom Fone provided a much needed structure for complementing early warning alerts and for receiving situational reports from the field once a disaster has struck.</p>
<p>This experiment points to the importance of integrating voice based communications as a complementary feature in any emergency relief operation. Voice based solutions not only provide more information than SMS, they also provide an immediate solution to language challenges faced by text communication. In many contexts languages are not supported by SMS, some audiences may be illiterate or simply a culture may be more predisposed to oral communication.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>From a global perspective, in our parts of the world people are vocal. We do business with voice. We don't write big memos, we don't write big e-mails, you just pick up the phone and you make a call, you talk to the person and you do your business. From that perspective Freedom Fone positions itself naturally in a very good way,</em>&quot; says Nuwan Waidanyatha.</p>
<p>Based on these trials Sarvodaya is now implementing Freedom Fone as part of their emergency response procedures.</p>
<p>LIRNEasia is further investigating how Freedom Fone integrates with the SAHANA disaster management system and other open-source platforms active in crisis communications. Details of this report are available at <a href="http://lirneasia.net/projects/2010-12-research-program/ff4edxl/%20" title="LIRNEasia report">http://lirneasia.net/projects/2010-12-research-program/ff4edxl/</a></p>

<h1>Kubatana Audio Drama</h1>
<p>The experience of Freedom Fone in Zimbabwe has shown that high call costs can be a challenge to getting callers to access information through <em>Voice Menus</em>. In 2009, the civic activist platform Kubatana <a href="http://www.kubatana.net">(www.kubatana.net)</a> used Freedom Fone to launched <em>Inzwa</em>, a call-in news headline service. They followed on with a constitutional reform information service, but came to realise that due to the high cost of phone calls, callers were more willing to pay for news and entertainment than civic information.</p>
<p>To test their entertainment theory, Kubatana experimented with micro audio dramas and Freedom Fone's <em>Voice Menus</em>. The dramas comprised 4 to 5 short audio episodes of roughly 2 minutes each, with the episodes each finishing with a compelling hook to the next in sequence. The idea was to use edutainment as a means of sharing information that audiences would otherwise find tiresome or difficult to consume. The episodes were kept short to minimise call costs.</p>
<p>Launched in June of 2010, <em>Tariro on Top</em> was an audio drama that raised awareness about sexual harassment in the workplace in Zimbabwe. The drama is about a chauvinist boss, Mr Kunaka, who is used to expecting sexual favours from his secretaries. Matters take an unexpected turn after he meets Tariro, a woman who is prepared to risk her job by rejecting his advances.</p>
<p>Below follows a transcript of the audio drama where Tariro, still a new employee, meets Mr. Kunaka:</p>
<p><strong>FELICITY</strong>: Uh-uh, jairai asikana. Hmmm your hair is so nice! What have you done? Wakaitirwa kupi?!<br />
<strong>TARIRO</strong>: Oh, thanks Felicity. Yah, you know, I thought now I have been transferred to this office to work for Mr-Most-High-and-Mighty-Kunaka, I should be looking really professional. That's why I thought short was maybe better. I don't want to be a secretary forever handitika, and if I can impress Mr Kunaka with my work . . .<br />
<strong>FELICITY</strong>: Ahhh, my dear, Tariro, listen. About impressing Mr Kunaka -<br />
<strong>MR KUNAKA</strong>: Hello ladies! Uribho Felicity, Uribho Tariro. Did you have a good weekend?<br />
<strong>TARIRO</strong>: Yes, thank you Mr Kunaka. And I want you to know that I'm very pleased to be finally working in this office.<br />
<strong>MR KUNAKA</strong>: Excellent, excellent, well, we are pleased to have you here I'm sure. I've always thought you had a lot of . . . potential.</p>
<p>Following on from the success of <em>Tariro on Top</em>, the Kubatana team created two other micro audio dramas - <em>Beckham in DZ</em> and <em>Big Dhara</em> - to highlight issues troubling young sexually active adults. Focus discussion groups were organised to identify and discuss common issues and thereby inform the script writing process.</p>
<p><img src="static/tariro.png" width="200" height="200" /> To minimise the loss of audio quality across mobile phone networks, Kubatana used a professional studio to record high quality audio files. They also engaged local drama students to add life to the characters' voices. Aware that their audio files eventually had to be downsampled for Freedom Fone, Kubatana made sure to start the process with quality recordings.</p>
<p>To promote the micro audio dramas, Kubatana make use of their extensive mailing list of over 10,000 addresses and SMS list of over 22,000 numbers. To engage new listeners they flight adverts in local newpapers and print colourful flyers that are handed out for free at traffic intersections. <em>Call data Records</em> show that advertising a service this way often increases the number of callers.</p>
<div class="speechBox">
<p><em>&quot;Freedom Fone opens doors. It's a new way of sharing information with an offline target audience. The popularity of Tariro on Top revealed that a service which deals with a social issue in an entertaining manner with strong characterisation and dramatisation was most popular. Call lengths were up to 10 minutes at a time which shows that people will pay for a service they are interested in.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Kubatana encourages feedback on the audio dramas and makes use of the <em>Leave-a-Message (LAM)</em> and <em>Incoming SMS</em> functions to receive critique and suggestions.</p>

<h1>Community Radio Harare</h1>
<p>Community Radio Harare (CORAH) is one of the main community radio stations in Zimbabwe. Based out of the capital city, they have been using Freedom Fone since October 2010 as an alternative to broadcast for <em>Free Voices Harare</em>, a community news programme.</p>
<p>Despite a political agreement signed in 2009 promising to liberalise media channels in Zimbabwe, no independent or community radio station currently has a licence to broadcast (May 2012). While CORAH waits for the government to issue operating licences, using Freedom Fone as a means of community outreach makes sense due to the widespread access to mobile phones.</p>
<p>CORAH used Freedom Fone to established <em>Free Voices Harare</em> as a citizen media initiative to encourage self-expression in marginalised communities around Harare. The service receives around 50 calls a day.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>We have trained citizen journalists in 30 wards so in each of those areas there are people who are trained to use Freedom Fone. People know how to phone in and deliver voice or text messages and even to listen to news, radio documentaries and then impart that information to their communities as well.</em>&quot;<br />
-- Givemore Chipere, Programming Manager, CORAH</p>
<p>CORAH is often first to break with local news stories thanks to the tips they receive from their network of community reporters.<br />
</p>
<p>CORAH realised that the inability to transmit via traditional radio actually presented opportunities for experimenting with new solutions for engaging with their community. Freedom Fone was particularly useful because it gave people a platform to not only listen to news but also to share news tips and eye witness reports from their areas via text or voice message.</p>
<p><img src="static/corah.png" /></p>
<p>&quot;<em>We saw it as an opportunity to offer people a platform for self-expression and it is working quite well because we are not using the regulated radio frequencies that the government does not want people to use. We found it as a very innovative way to offer people a means of self-expression</em>,&quot; explains Chipere.</p>
<p>Despite major challenges and lack of resources, Community Radio Harare continues to use Freedom Fone in conjunction with other media platforms like bulk-SMS, audio documentaries, website (<a href="http://www.corah.org.zw">www.corah.org.zw</a>) and e-newsletters to build community listenership and participation. As Chipere notes, all of the information they receive through their Freedom Fone service serves both as content for their news service and helps to inform future programmes.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Platforms like Freedom Fone allow people to communicate, allow people to broadcast in one way or another without using the regulated frequencies that the broadcasting authorities are holding on to. The growth in IT will present us with many opportunities for self-expression and communication.</em>&quot;</p>
<h2>Role of Freedom Fone:</h2>
<ul>
<li>An alternative to traditional broadcast</li>
<li>A tool for citizen journalism</li>
<li>Creating an information-on-demand service</li>
<li>A complementary tool for other media</li>

<p><span id="ch010_vaccination-campaign.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Vaccination campaign</h1>
<p>Achieving full coverage in vaccination campaigns can be difficult. It depends a lot on community trust and ensuring consistent information to target populations.</p>
<h2>Shamiso's dilemma</h2>
<p>Shamiso and her husband Musa have three children. They are devoutly religious and members of an evangelical church that generally disapproves of vaccinations and other health interventions.</p>
<p>Now there is an outbreak of measles in their district. Health and child protection agencies have visited their village pleading with them to take their children for vaccination.</p>
<p>Shamiso feels she should take their children but doesn't want to disobey her husband or their church leaders and cause conflict. She feels torn between protecting her children and going against her culture and religion. What can she do?</p>
<h2>Raphael's story</h2>
<p>Raphael is the local district vaccination campaign co-ordinator and is looking closely at the coverage in the District. He sees that the campaign is faltering in the villages where the church has strong leadership. He decides to act: he calls a meeting with the church leaders, and they agree to endorse the campaign.</p>
<p>Leaflets are drawn up with the church leaders endorsement and distributed; meetings are held. The villagers receive the information but they mistrust what is written. Nothing validates the statements made that the church leaders now endorse the campaign. Numbers of vaccinations continue to fall in some areas.</p>
<h2>How to move forward?</h2>
<p>Raphael has heard about <strong>Freedom Fone</strong> and sees a solution. He sets up a team. The finance officer orders the equipment. The IT officer sets it up and the community mobilisers help to record simple <em>Voice Menus</em> in their local language.</p>
<p>Raphael gets the church leader, Prophet Johannes, to record a <strong></strong> <em>Voice Message</em> endorsing the vaccination programme and asking members of his church to bring their children forward to the vaccination centres. This is the flagship message of their service. Raphael sets up a voice menu and sends an <strong></strong> <em>SMS</em> to his community mobilizers asking them to encourage villagers to call the number.</p>
<h2>A little later ...</h2>
<p>Shamiso calls the number from her village and she hears this <em>voice menu</em> ...</p>
<p><em>&quot;To hear Prophet Johannes message on vaccination, Press 1&quot;</em><br />
Shamiso and her husband Musa play the message together. The voice of their church leader reassures them.</p>
<p><em>&quot;To learn where and when to bring your child for vaccination, Press 2&quot;</em><br />
Her and her husband agree to take their children to the vaccination centre immediately.</p>
<p><em>&quot;To learn more about the symptoms of measles, Press 3&quot;</em><br />
A few of the village children are sick and she is not sure if it may be measles or something else. They decide to check up on them.</p>
<p><em>&quot;If you see measles in your village and think a health worker should visit, Press 4 to leave us a message&quot;</em><br />
Shamiso <em>leaves a message</em> with her village and her name on the Freedom Fone Service. A health worker soon visits them and reassures them that it is not measles.</p>
<p><img src="static/clinic.png" /></p>
<h2>Impact</h2>
<p>Raphael starts to see the numbers rise of parents coming forward. He uses the <em>Statistics and Reporting</em> function of Freedom Fone to continuously monitor the levels of calls and direct his health workers to areas that are still low in coming forward.</p>
<p>Raphael keeps Prophet Johannes in the loop and agrees to publicize a prayer service to be held in the coming weeks so as to further endorse the campaign and give guidance to the villagers in the District.</p>
<p>Shamiso is proud and relieved that she and Musa found a solution to her dilemma and that her children are protected.</p>
<p>The district is evaluated and found to have the best universal coverage statistics in the campaign.</p>

<h1>Supporting Women's Rights</h1>
<p>Kalila is a Human Rights activist. She lives in a medium-size city in an Arab country. One year ago she set up a small organization focusing on Women's Rights. As part of a programme which also includes conferences in schools and capacity-building of social workers, she is now running a Freedom Fone Service aiming to denounce sexist comments or insults that women in her area often have to endure in their daily life, in particular on the street.</p>
<p>Thanks to Freedom Fone, in the event of any incident involving abuse towards women in Kalila's neighbourhood, victims can now use <em>SMS</em> to text in the insult addressed to them and the location where it happened<em></em>. They can also call into the service to <em>Leave-a-Message</em> and report their story. Kalila and her colleagues maintain a database of all the incidents, which they have integrated with a map of the area that is available on their organization's website. The map, which is updated every week, provides a humorous but accurate snapshot of &quot;the most sexist areas in our community!&quot;</p>
<p>Women can also call in to hear a selection of other women's testimonies, as well as listen to a weekly 3-minute <em>Audio Drama</em> providing tips and tricks on how to respond in case of harassment and suggest appropriate answers to insults.</p>
<p>Kalila and her colleagues used small posters to advertise the service and call for action. They placed them in strategic meeting places such as schools, clinics, bus stops and also hairdressers and beauty centres. Kalila's younger cousin, who is studying graphic design, helped design the poster using cartoon-type characters so that it looks attractive. Word of mouth did the rest and the service now starts to be quite popular in the city!</p>
<p>Mayssa is a 20-year old student living in the same city as Kalila. She hates receiving degrading comments from men in the street and having them wolf whistle at her. She enjoys calling the service to listen to the Audio Drama. Sometimes she calls several times a week to listen to the same episode with her cousins or friends. She comments:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>You know, in our society many men do not think that women have the same rights. And even if this is a serious topic, I like this audio drama because it is really humorous. Some of the testimonies are also amusing although the problem is very real! Myself I really got fed up with this type of behaviour and it was a relief for me to hear that I was not alone and that I have the choice to answer back. This programme really creates a spirit of solidarity among women, and it reinforces our awareness about our Rights!</em>&quot;</p>
<p>Since Kalila's organisation uses the security version of Freedom Fone, the database of callers' numbers can only be accessed by the administrator - you know, just in case. Kalila is now thinking about extending the service to other countries. She is also in discussion with her friends Whalid and Susan on how they could turn the service into a Radio Programme.</p>

<h1>Enhancing business opportunities</h1>
<p>Tina has just started ZimOut: an entertainment magazine that covers events, an eat-out, cinema and festival guide in her hometown Harare. For a while she has been struggling to cover print costs and distribution in a city where there are already two established magazines that deal with events and entertainment.</p>
<p>Both of her competitors already reach a young middle-class audience who are internet savvy and only attend established and pricy venues. After hearing about the successes of Freedom Fone at her local community radio where her friend Joe works, Tina decides to try a little experiment. She sees a chance to use Freedom Fone to target a wider audience to complement her magazine. Besides the usual &quot;hype&quot; places, she plans to promote interesting, less frequented venues and events, while attracting more advertising. Can it work?</p>
<p>After downloading the latest version of Freedom Fone from the website (what has she to lose, after all it's free!) and investing in a one sim-card <em>MobiGater</em> – the cheapest option that will suit her trial version - she begins to plan her rocking new service.</p>
<p>The idea is for a ZimOut hotline that anyone can call at any time, night or day, and receive instant, up-to-date information on events, eating-out, films, gigs and upcoming events. The service uses the <em>Voice Menu</em> functions:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>To find out what is going on tonight in your area, press 1; to listen to the latest review of best restaurants, press 2.&quot;</em> etc.</p>
<p>A final option encourages callers to <em>Leave-a-Message</em> and share their feedback and experience, with the added incentive of winning a free year subscription to ZimOut for the most interesting story.</p>
<p>On each monthly edition of her magazine Tina dedicates a margin on the back cover to advertise the ZimOut hotline. To create more publicity, she also asks Joe at radio to publicise the ZimOut hotline in their daily broadcasts. Within no time at all the service is receiving up to 300 callers a day and has a number of entertaining text messages and soundbites for Tina to include on both her print and website edition.</p>
<p>Wilfred and Sheila, an elderly couple who have become avid subscribers to ZimOut for its entertaining stories and regular callers to the hotline had this to say:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>ZimOut is just for us. Before we hardly ever went out because we never knew what was on and when and what sort of service to expect. Now, we can easily find out what's happening when we want</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>Soon advertisers are interested in this new, interactive space and are asking to be featured on the ZimOut hotline. With the added revenue, Tina decides to upgrade to a 4-sim card <em>OfficeRoute</em>; she keeps two lines open for the ZimOut hotline, keeping advertising to a minimum so as not to turn-off callers with longer and more expensive menus. She then offers the two other lines to post classifieds and to promote events for a fee.</p>
<p>ZimOut has now become the most popular entertainment magazine in Harare, using its print and online editions to run interesting features and reviews while running their Freedom Fone hotline as both an advertising and informative entertainment space.</p>

<h1>Recording oral histories</h1>
<p>Imagine a walk through the city of Berlin. As you pass a now nearly invisible checkpoint where the former Berlin Wall once stood, you can dial a <em>Freedom Fone Service</em> and listen to sound recordings that bring to life the history of that particular spot.</p>
<p>Suddenly you can hear the shootings of fugitives from a once divided city followed by the celebratory shouts on the day the Wall went down. Continue past the Dom (cathedral) and you can choose to hear a historical account of the architecture but also the story about the original building plan which was secretly hidden by one of the carpenters in the steeple.</p>
<p><img src="static/heritage.png" /></p>
<p>An ordinary house may grab your attention because of the grafitti on the wall. As you listen to information left on the <em>Voice Menu</em> function you find out that during World War Two a Jewish family was hiding in the attic to escape the holocaust. Later you pass a house where the poet and playwright Bertold Brecht once lived. You can listen to one of his most famous poems while you rest a little.</p>
<p>Now imagine the city you live in. You'll find that nearly everything has a hidden story to tell: a house, a tree, a street, a river, an abandoned train track... Even an empty space might have a story to tell – missing houses that were once a distinctive feature of the landscape or environment and are now reduced to dust. But somewhere a living memory survives.  </p>
<p>Imagine your community Council, a cultural organisation or even a group of students using <em>Freedom Fone </em>to build a virtual history of your city or community. Audio content is created by a small team of editors and uploaded onto alternate <em>Voice Menus</em> that can be listened to on an on-demand basis including a mix of speech, music and poetry. The service is widely advertised using flyers or posters to allow the general public to <em>Leave-a-Message</em> in places where they recall important events that happened at a certain time or place. Callers' stories can be stored on a public archive linked to an interactive online map while being integrated back into the service.<br />
</p>
<p>As long as you are carrying your mobile phone you can call on the spot, listen to recordings that trigger memories and participate in creating a collective history. Reminding people of their cultural and collective heritage can create a sense of shared memory, common belonging and civic solidarity in any city or community.</p>

<p><span id="ch014_election-monitoring.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Election monitoring</h1>
<p>As of June 2012, SODNET in Kenya are working to integrate Freedom Fone into the Uchaguzi platform that is now being used in 4 different African countries to monitor elections. Uchaguzi is a civic platform that uses multiple channels to crowd source information, document violations and mobilise resources to address problems raised by accredited monitors or the general public.</p>
<p>National elections are highly fraught events in many countries. Electoral fraud, vote buying, intimidation, violence, media censorship and abuse of government resources are some of the issues that plague these events.</p>
<p><img src="static/election.png" /></p>
<p>Freedom Fone can be an important addition to the platform as it allows an organisation's staff, trained monitors or the general public to get involved <em></em> if there is a critical event or situation thanks to the <em>Leave-a-Message</em> function. Reporting via voice messages can be easier to do while remaining vigilant and staying out of harm's way and the organisation can always follow up on a caller's message to verify and clarify information.</p>
<p><em>Voice Menu</em> functions can also provide a useful service to rural and/or disconnected audiences by providing information on demand news updates as an election unfolds. This would be particularly valuable to callers as an alternative to highly politicised broadcast channels. Election monitors and staff can also benefit from this service once they are in the field and disconnected from their usual sources of information.</p>
<p>Freedom Fone's <em>Security functions</em> allow an organisation to limit access to callers' personal details to trusted staff while allowing other staff and volunteers to read the content of SMSs and listen to voice messages. This prevents the abuse of information that could jeopardise the identity and whereabouts of monitors or callers.</p>

<p><span id="ch015_at-the-radio-station.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>At the radio station</h1>
<p>Radio stations are in many ways, ideally positioned to benefit from and launch a successful Freedom Fone service:</p>
<ul>
<li>Radio stations already have an audience</li>
<li>they are familiar with the challenges and opportunities of audio</li>
<li>they usually have in-house IT competencies to support the installation of Freedom Fone</li>
<li>they have a powerful channel for advertising their Freedom Fone service through on-air announcements/spots on the radio</li>
<li>Freedom Fone can leverage the impact of any radio programmes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Imagine you have a radio station that is packed with a schedule of popular radio programmes hosted by presenters who each have a group of loyal listeners. Perhaps your station is looking for new ways to interact and engage with listeners because you lack a comprehensive system for two-way communications with listeners. Here are some ways that Freedom Fone can be used at the radio station:</p>
<h2>Gathering your listeners' voices</h2>
<p>Including the voices of listeners in radio broadcasts adds a richness and depth to any radio programme but is especially powerful for community radio stations. Getting into the field to conduct direct interviews can be expensive and logistically difficult. The <em>Leave-a-Message</em> functionality of Freedom Fone enables your radio station to receive a variety of audio messages from your listeners. Here are a few of the possible applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Citizen Reporting:</strong> Citizens can become reporters by recording their news stories directly into the station's leave-a-message inbox;</li>
<li><strong>Wedding and funeral announcements</strong> can be recorded into a community announcements leave-a-message inbox for replay on-air at a later time;</li>
<li><strong>Call in questions</strong> can be recorded by callers and answered on-air by the show's presenter;</li>
<li><strong>Games and competitions</strong> can be created on-air and listeners are invited to participate by leaving a message. Radio presenters can then re-broadcast the winning entries;</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Leave-a-message inboxes</strong> allows each presenter of a programme to have their own service on the Freedom Fone. It's possible to have different phone numbers per service;</li>
<li><strong>Audio auditions</strong> for new DJs can be conducted by asking applicants to call in and leave a message sharing why they think they're a good candidate for the job.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<em>How would you use the Leave-a-message service at your radio station?</em>
</blockquote>
<h2>Gathering your listeners' opinions</h2>
<p>Through the <em>SMS poll</em> functionality of Freedom Fone, audience members are able to participate in opinion polls on topics by sending an SMS from their (or someone else's) mobile phone. As a radio station, conducting frequent listener polls can be a powerful way to get your finger on the pulse of your listeners in a quick and measurable way. A listening audience is usually keen to participate when possible and polls can deepen their relationship with your radio station. A few possible applications of SMS polls at the radio station:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Your radio station can ask your audience to report on the status of public services in their area including clinics, power outages and garbage collection;</li>
<li><strong>Song of the day</strong>: Listeners can vote for their favorite song of the day;</li>
<li><strong>Tomorrow's topics</strong>: Invite your listeners to vote on topics they would like to learn more about in upcoming broadcasts.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<em>What ideas do you have for using SMS polls at your radio station? Lets talk!</em>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also receive standard text messages using Freedom Fone's <em>Incoming SMS</em> function. Any message the doesn't qualify as an <em>SMS poll</em> 'vote' will automatically be received as an Incoming SMS. This means that you can receive free format queries, reports, tip-offs, feedback and other requests via ordinary SMS if you wish.</p>
<h2>Giving your listeners audio-on-demand</h2>
<p>By creating <em>Voice Menus</em>, content from the radio station's different radio programmes can be used to make précised versions of audio information available &quot;off-air&quot; to listeners over the phone. <em>Information-on-demand</em> allows your audience to choose when and from where they want to listen to audio you make available. A few possible ways to use <em>Voice menus</em> at the radio station include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>News summaries:</strong> Highlights from each day's news can be recorded live and then edited into short audio segments for listening on demand through a phone call.</li>
<li><strong>Weather forecasts and market prices:</strong> Commonly accessed information which has been broadcast throughout the day, can be very useful for listeners to get on demand.</li>
<li><strong>Advertising rates:</strong> Audience and community members can easily learn about your rates if the latest information is made available.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>What information would you make available through Voice Menus? Lets talk!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To announce the service to your listeners, why not prepare several radio spots that explain the new features as well as the phone numbers to call. Stickers and postcards advertising the service and phone numbers can be distributed in communities and handed out at any radio events.</p>
<p>The Freedom Fone Service can be used to generate an extra income stream by having sponsors put their own jingles in the <em>Voice menu</em> and/or <em>Leave-a-Message</em> services. For example, callers could hear a short message &quot;This competition brought to you by...&quot; before they are prompted to record their message for the radio station. This sponsorship could be changed periodically.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Freedom Fone is designed to get an information service up and running rapidly, within a matter of hours of installing the software. You can just go ahead and do this and it can prove to be very effective with very little planning or set up. This makes Freedom Fone ideal for contexts where rapid deployment is necessary. However if you have the time and resources you may wish to consider spending more time on planning and producing your Freedom Fone information.</p>
<p>If security of information from and about your audience is a big issue then look at the chapter on <em>security</em>.</p>
<p>If you decide to dedicate the resources to planning then this section outlines the steps you can take to create your information service:</p>
<p><img src="static/designintro.png" /></p>
<p><span id="ch018_equipment.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Equipment</h1>
<p>Freedom Fone is free, simple to install and easy to use. The basic setup is portable (you do need a power supply though) and requires very little to get up and running.</p>
<p>If you'd like to see how Freedom Fone works without installing it, you can try our online demo: <a href="http://demo.freedomfone.org" class="uri">http://demo.freedomfone.org</a></p>
<h2>Equipment setup and costs</h2>
<p>If you decide to install the software and set up your own Freedom Fone installation, here's what you will need and some approximate costs:</p>
<p><img src="static/equip_budget_1.png" /> <br />
</p>
<p><em>Notes:<br />
1. Freedom Fone does not run on Mac hardware and we recommend installing on non-Macintosh computers.<br />
2. Backup inverters must be of the pure sine wave type.</em></p>
<p>For procedures to install the Freedom Fone software, hardware requirements, connecting your hardware and testing your SIM cards - see the section <em>Technical stuff</em>.</p>
<p><img src="static/tech3revised.png" />  </p>
<h2>What does my audience need?</h2>
<ul>
<li>A phone (fixed/landline, mobile phone, or Skype with call out credit)</li>
<li>Mobile phone credit if calling from a mobile phone</li>
<li>Adequate reception if calling from a mobile phone or internet access if using Skype</li>
</ul>
<h2>Updates and maintenance</h2>
<p>From time to time you may encounter technical challenges and it is therefore a good idea to have someone technical help purchase, install and set up your Freedom Fone service. The software is periodically updated as new features are released or bugs fixed. For these reasons, it is recommended to have access to a technical person when deploying Freedom Fone (for more information on staffing issues see the <em>Organize your staff</em> chapter).</p>
<p><span id="ch019_know-your-audience.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Know your audience</h1>
<p>The most important part of your Freedom Fone Service is knowing your audience. As you build the service, it is your audience who will be calling in to use it, so it is worth spending some extra time to get to know more about them. The better you know your audience and their information needs, the more effectively you can design the service so that it works for them!</p>
<p>The following are some thoughts for you to consider as you get to know your audience better.</p>
<h2>What languages do your audience speak?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>It is possible to make your Freedom Fone Service available in multiple languages to reach a wider audience; this also increases the amount of work required in preparing audio content. Decisions about what languages you will provide your service in will impact who uses the service and the value they attach to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>What is the age of your audience?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Young people tend to be more technology savvy when it comes to using mobile phones and will likely find it easier to learn to use the Freedom Fone Service than an older generation. As you design the service, keep in mind how to best communicate with your target age group.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Where do they currently get information?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>It is quite possible that your audience are getting the information you are proposing to offer through other means at the moment. It is useful to find out as much as you can about these sources and assess their strengths and weaknesses. This will guide the design of your Freedom Fone Service to improve upon existing sources and offer new value.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>What do they consider valuable?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>If a caller finds the information you make available valuable enough, they will bear the cost of making the call to your Freedom Fone Service. Find out what makes your information unique and consider how to prepare it in a concise way so that it is smoothly accessible over the phone.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>What does your audience find funny?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Humour is an excellent way to keep people coming back to your Freedom Fone Service again and again. Find out if there are comedians, jokes or types of entertainment that you could integrate into your service to keep it entertaining and informative at the same time.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Income levels of your audience?</h2>
<blockquote>
Typically those with a higher income level will spend more time on your Freedom Fone Service compared to those with a lower income. Many people are conservative with their mobile phone airtime so it is important to consider who you want to reach and what they will consider valuable enough to make that call to your service.
</blockquote>
<h2>What mobile networks do people use?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Certain mobile networks may be more popular with your target audience than others, this can help guide you in many ways including approaching a mobile network to partner with, for example to get a toll-free number. It is also possible to take advantage of certain tariffs and promotions offered by a network to lower the cost of calls.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Conduct a Focus Group Discussion</h2>
<p>One excellent way to further conceptualize and design your Freedom Fone Service is to invite the very people who will be using it to talk as a group! If you can arrange to travel to where the audience is based and make it easy for them to participate you will increase your chances of getting a higher number of participants.</p>
<p>Consider dividing the participants into three groups: Adult men, Adult women and youth - this can help you get different perspectives and allows participants to share more freely.</p>
<p>Usually, the outcomes from these discussions will be very helpful in refining your initial ideas about the Freedom Fone Service into something even more attractive and useful to your audience.</p>
<h2>Setup a stakeholder meeting</h2>
<p>The outcomes of the focus group discussion with your audience can be used to gather all the stakeholders involved including the ones who will be the information sources that will create the content for your service. A participatory process of engaging this group with a facilitator to lead the process can help ensure that your service is relevant, realistic and most importantly - of value to your callers.</p>
<h2>Educating your audience</h2>
<p>For many callers this will be the first time they have used an <em>Interactive Voice Response (IVR)</em> system - they may need some extra help in understanding how to use the service/technology. Here are some possible ways to introduce them to your service:</p>
<h2>Use the radio to demonstrate</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A familiar and likeable radio presenter could be a perfect candidate for demonstrating and introducing your audience to how to use your Freedom Fone Service. By making an example phone call to your service live on-air through the radio, your audience can hear an actual example of your Freedom Fone Service and how to interact with it. The radio presenter will gently guide them through the steps. This broadcast can be recorded and replayed as a radio spot throughout the day on the radio.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Follow up with one-time callers</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>If IVR is a new experience to many of your audience they may hang up in the first five or ten seconds of their first call because they are uncertain of what to do. Consider having a real person follow up with these one-time callers with a phone call to ask the caller if they need any help with using the service or have any questions. This also builds a nice connection between you and your audience.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Downstream training in public places</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Public places where many of your audience might be gathered on a daily basis such as markets, clinics, churches, mosques, bus stops etc can be an excellent place to demonstrate the usage of your service. Consider having a battery powered PA address system or loudspeaker connected to a mobile phone and demonstrate how to use the Freedom Fone Service. This can also be an excellent place to hand out stickers, postcards or other marketing materials advertising your Freedom Fone service phone numbers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Checking in with your audience</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you on track? See the chapter <em>Monitoring and evaluation</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span id="ch020_choose-your-information-sources.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Choose your information sources</h1>
<p>Once you feel you know your audience well enough and understand their information needs, the next step is to get to know your information sources. These information sources, as there may be several, are how you create your content and are at the heart of your Freedom Fone Service (unless you are just using the <em>Leave-a-message</em> functionality exclusively and not using the voice menus). The following are some possible examples of where your information sources can come from. This list is by no means exhaustive.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scripted content:</strong> eg. A micro drama with characters and a storyline could be produced as a part of a campaign with episodes shared on a weekly basis. This requires writers and voice actors.</li>
<li><strong>Third party sources</strong>: eg. Market prices printed in the newspaper can be recorded into audio and made available through voice menus on the Freedom Fone Service.</li>
<li><strong>Previously broadcasted audio</strong>: eg. A radio station that broadcasts news headlines, weather forecasts or important information throughout the day can also make a shortened form of the audio available on-demand on a Freedom Fone Service</li>
<li><strong>Caller contributions:</strong> eg. Re-use the voices and stories recorded from your callers who have used the <em>Leave-a-message</em> function and make their recordings available for others to hear on the Freedom Fone Service.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>These are a few possibilities - what information sources are you planning to use?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Selecting information sources</h2>
<p>Because the information sources are the heart of your Freedom Fone service, it is worth mentioning some other considerations that may help you get your service running smoothly from the get go.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> In instances where sensitive information is gathered you might consider an information verification process that suits your service. If caller security is a concern where exposure may add to vulnerability, consider implementing the security functions discussed in the <em>Security</em> chapter in the <em>Setting up</em> section.</li>
<li><strong>Reliability:</strong> If you are planning to use information sources from outside of your organization such as agricultural extension agents, community media organizations or election monitors, it is important to consider their ability to reliably deliver information to your service. Consistency is important to keeping your audience engaged - so choose information sources that can be consistent. For mission critical services it is worth making back up plans in case your sources are unable to deliver their information.</li>
<li><strong>Copyright and ownership:</strong> It may seem obvious but you want to ensure that the content you are including in your <em>Voice menus</em> is in fact owned by you or you have permission to use and share it freely.</li>
<li><strong>Relevance:</strong> Based on knowing your audience (see previous chapter), you want to choose information sources that your audience find relevant and worth making a call to listen to.</li>
<li><strong>Topicality:</strong> &quot;Stale news is no news&quot; - people want fresh and up to date information. When selecting your information sources, make sure you can keep things current.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How often to update your information?</h2>
<p>Keeping the information and content on your Freedom Fone Service up to date is one of the best ways to ensure that your callers will use your system on a regular basis. It is up to you and your audience to determine what the frequency of these updates will be: eg. daily, weekly, bi-weekly or monthly. Once you have identified the update schedule of your service, it is important to stick to the rhythm so that the audience know how often they can expect to use your service and when.</p>
<p>First time installers of Freedom Fone often underestimate the amount of work and time that goes into maintaining your service. You might like to try creating some audio content before committing to a daily update.</p>
<p><span id="ch021_design-your-service.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Design your service</h1>
<p>Now that you know your audience's needs and you have an idea of where your information sources are coming from, it's time to design the architecture of your service. Freedom Fone software makes available a variety of components to help you interact with your audience. You can build your Freedom Fone Service out of a combination of any number of these components (see sections <em>Real life examples</em> and <em>Other possible scenarios</em> for examples of how others have used these components to create their Freedom Fone Services):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Leave-a-message (LAM)</strong> - The <em>LAM</em> function is an effective way of establishing two-way communication with your callers. With the <em>Leave-a-message</em> function the caller can leave a question, comment or report in audio form on your Freedom Fone system. Audio messages enable your callers to express themselves more freely and Freedom Fone captures those messages without loss of meaning or character. The content left by your callers can be played and listened to from the Freedom Fone interface. In addition to being a platform for leaving questions, the <em>Leave-a-message</em> service can be useful as an alert platform for callers to alert you to issues that need your attention. Content left by callers can also be re-used, for example you could select 5 stories submitted for a competition using LAM, re-broadcast these and allow the public to vote for their favourites. Voice messages can also be downloaded from Freedom Fone as MP3 files. (For more information see the <em>Leave-a-message</em> chapter in <em><strong>Setting up</strong></em>)</li>
<li><strong>Voice Menus</strong> - enable you to create an information tree which your callers can navigate through with the aid of dialling keys on a telephone keypad. You can imagine a voice menu as a grouping of similar content which you would like your callers to access. Each content item in your menu will be linked to a unique digit on your telephone keypad. The process of embedding <em>voice menus</em> within existing <em>voice menus</em>, which we call nesting, allows you to extend your information tree and hence provide more content to your callers. It's worth noting that multilingual services can be created by linking voice menus. (For more information see the <em>Voice menus</em> chapter in <em><strong>Setting up</strong></em>)</li>
<li><strong>Incoming SMS</strong> - allows you to receive ordinary <em>SMS</em> messages and view them in a reader friendly interface. Through the Freedom Fone interface you can then export the <em>SMSs</em> into any content management service of choice. Freedom Fone does not have the functionality for you to send SMSs. There are already several tools available to send SMSs effectively and integration with one of these tools, FrontlineSMS, is on the agenda for 2012.<br />
(For more information see the <em>Incoming SMS</em> chapter in <em><strong>Setting up</strong></em>)</li>
<li><strong>Polls</strong> - A simple and fast way to measure opinion on an issue is to conduct <em>SMS-based polls</em>. <em>SMS</em> polls enable your callers to respond to a structured question via an SMS response. As the SMSs arrive on the Freedom Fone system the individual SMSs are tallied and a summarized tabular output is generated. In scenarios which need urgent action but yet rely heavily on evidence-based information to take the first step, SMS polls can be a powerful and effective tool.<br />
(For more information see the <em>Polls</em> chapter in <em><strong>Setting up</strong></em>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sketching it out on paper</h2>
<p>One of the best ways to get an idea of how these components fit together as building blocks in your Freedom Fone Service is to draw it out on paper. (For an example of how <em>Voice Menus</em> can be organized into a service see chapter <em>Voice Menus</em> in the <strong><em>Setting up</em></strong> section).</p>
<p>Putting your ideas on paper is helpful because several people can work together, it's easy to illustrate your ideas and can help simplify and clarify the creation of your service.</p>
<p>In our experience, you need an operational staff member or volunteer to maintain the system. Ideally, their roles should be thought of as an outreach officer to your audience.</p>
<p>Resources they will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Time to manage the Freedom Fone Service</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mobile phone credit to coordinate with information sources</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Email and web access</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Travel allowances to meet with audience and stakeholders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simple audio recorder</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Computer access to</p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>Edit and produce <em>Voice Menus</em></li>
<li>Check <em>Leave-a-message</em> recordings from callers</li>
<li>Check <em>Incoming SMS</em></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>For more information see chapter <em>Staffing your Service</em>.</p>
<h2>How often to update your information?</h2>
<p>See the chapter: <em>Organise your staff</em>.</p>
<h2>Plan to refine your service</h2>
<p>Your Freedom Fone Service is a continually evolving creation - as your audience grows and changes, so should your service. Conducting surveys with some of the &quot;top callers&quot; who use your service frequently can be an excellent way to get insight into what people like about your service - consider consulting your top callers when you are ready to make some changes to your service. <em>Call data records (CDR)</em> and Freedom Fone's inbuilt <em>System data</em> can provide you with comprehensive statistics that will give you an idea of how people are using your system. See the chapter on <em>Monitoring and Evaluation</em> for further information on this topic.</p>
<p><span id="ch022_create-voice-menus.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Create voice menus</h1>
<p>Now that you have designed an architecture for how you will use the various components of Freedom Fone to design an information service, you will need to think about creating <em>voice menus.</em></p>
<p>The last thing that you want when building a <em>voice menu</em> is to bore your audience or even worse let them get lost in the menu.</p>
<p>To build a successful menu:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stick to simple language</strong> which people can understand; avoid using complicated medical or legal terms for example.</li>
<li><strong>Keep your introduction short</strong> it is important that you let your callers know what to expect immediately: example: &quot;<em>Welcome to the Cholera epidemics emergency information service</em>&quot;.</li>
<li><strong>Limit the number of menu choices</strong>: People tend to forget if they are offered too many choices.</li>
<li><strong>Make a pleasant error message:</strong> The system should always take the blame for errors. &quot;<em>Sorry, I do not understand your choice; do you want to press another number?</em> &quot;</li>
<li><strong>Keep your information up to date</strong>: Let your audience know how often they can expect to find new information on your service. This will help you keep them calling back.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an example of an efficient <em>voice menu</em>:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Welcome to the Cholera epidemics emergency information service ; this information is updated twice a day</em>. Please listen carefully to the following five options&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>For signs and symptoms, press 1;</em></li>
<li><em>For first aid treatment, press 2;</em></li>
<li><em>Emergency treatment centers, 3;</em></li>
<li><em>Avoiding contagion, 4;</em></li>
<li><em>To leave us a message, press 5;</em></li>
<li><em>To end this call, just hang up.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about how to create <em>voice</em> menus in the Freedom Fone software, see the Chapter <em>Voice menus</em> in the <em>Setting up</em> section.</p>
<h2>Female voices</h2>
<p>When considering the voice that will be used on the audio menus (the host), consider choosing someone who the audience likes and can connect with - in our experience callers prefer to hear a female voice as a host.</p>
<h2>Language Selector</h2>
<p>The Language Selector helps you manage multilingual voice menus.<br />
</p>
<p>If, for example, you want to deliver your voice menus in English and Swahili, you would first need to create separate content files and voice menus for each language. Thereafter, you can link the voice menus using the <em>Language Selector</em>.</p>
<p>To create a language selector, navigate to <em>IVR Centre &gt; Language Selector</em>.  On the page shown below, click on the <em>Create New</em> button.</p>
<p> <img src="static/Language_selector.png" /></p>
<p>On the next page, shown below, you enter the name of the Language Selector and upload the audio files for the instructions and the invalid message.</p>
<p> <img src="static/Create_lang_select.png" /></p>
<p>At the bottom of the page, under <em>Menu Options</em>, select the type of service (Voice menus, Leave-a-message menu, Content) you wish to link to the top menu of your language selector. If you have created the same voice menu in different languages, you would select <em>Voice Menus</em> from the pull down menu.</p>
<p>Once you have made a selection, further options will become available to you, enabling you to set up navigation for your voice menus.  Save the page after making your selections.</p>
<p><img src="static/Lang_select_menu_options.png" /></p>
<p>Once you have created a Language Selector you can return to edit it using the edit icon on the Language Selectors page. You will note that the Edit Language Selector page looks just like the Edit Voice Menus page.<br />
</p>
<p><span id="ch023_organise-your-staff.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Organise your staff</h1>
<p>Keeping your Freedom Fone service running requires staff or volunteers. It is common that people underestimate the work that is needed to manage the content, communicate with callers and monitor the usage of their Freedom Fone service. It is therefore best to plan from the start to have staff in at least two capacities: technical and operational.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> we know that budgets are often limited in organizations planning to provide a Freedom Fone service and the workloads for current staff is typically already high - adding the following tasks and resources may be too much. It should be pointed out that Freedom Fone can certainly be a part-time task for existing staff members if you are not able to dedicate full time staff to the service, however we recommend planning for success by freeing up staff and financial resources.</p>
<h2>Duties</h2>
<p>The following are some typical tasks that could be assigned to two different staff members involved in your Freedom Fone service:</p>
<p><strong>Technical staff</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Purchases and sets up the equipment</li>
<li>Installs the Freedom Fone software</li>
<li>Troubleshoots, maintains and updates the system</li>
<li>Trains the operational staff on how to use the system</li>
<li>Supports operational staff with recording, editing and uploading voice menus</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Operational staff</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Considers audience needs and liaises with them</li>
<li>Scripts and records voice menus</li>
<li>Checks for and replies to incoming audio messages and SMS</li>
<li>Incorporates caller contributions</li>
<li>Administers SMS polls</li>
<li>Exports and analyses system data</li>
<li>Conducts audience surveys and evaluations</li>
<li>Gathers contributions from external information sources</li>
</ul>
<h2>Resources needed for your staff</h2>
<p>In our experience, the operational staff in particular need the following resources to help them in managing the Freedom Fone service:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mobile phone credit to coordinate with audience and information sources</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Email and web access</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Travel allowances to occasionally meet with audience and stakeholders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simple audio recorder to gather interviews in the field</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Computer access to conduct the following tasks:</p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>Edit and produce audio menus</li>
<li>Check Leave-a-message recordings from callers</li>
<li>Check SMS</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Try-and-see is probably the best approach to finding an efficient workflow with your staff and resources - with time you will know what you need to adjust to keep the service running. This will likely change over time as your service changes.<br />
</p>
<p><span id="ch024_advertise-your-service.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Advertise your service</h1>
<p>So, you have created your Freedom Fone service and you are ready to get the word out and advertise. A crucial question to address now is: how are you going to spread the word about your service? This chapter looks at what is involved in advertising your service.</p>
<h2>Budget for your advertising</h2>
<p>One common oversight when creating a Freedom Fone service is to forget about the costs associated with keeping your service running and advertising is a big part of this - people cannot call the service if they don't know about it or which number to call. Depending on which of the advertising techniques you choose to use below, it is important to set aside some money in your annual budget for this.</p>
<h2>Advertising techniques</h2>
<p>Because your primary target are people who have limited or no internet access, many of whom may be semi- or illiterate and may speak minority languages, it is important to carefully consider your advertising methods to suit your target market.</p>
<p>We recommend prioritising the following offline advertising techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Newspaper</strong>: advertising in papers that are popular among your audience (Kubatana, when deploying Freedom Fone for an edutainment audio drama, even got the idea to place personal advertisements in local daily newspapers to pique the interest of the many Zimbabweans who read the personals!).</li>
<li><strong>Posters:</strong> placed strategic meeting places such as schools, clinics, bus stops, civil society organisations, etc. Consider using illustrations, cartoons or other images to make your information more broadly accessible.</li>
<li><strong>Postcards and stickers:</strong> that advertise your service can be distributed at traffic lights during peak traffic periods, inserted into newspapers, or distributed at the same points mentioned for posters.</li>
<li><strong>Community Radio:</strong> depending on your budget you could either buy an advertising spot or participate in an existing popular talk show where you can discuss your project and thereby advertise for free. Ensure your target audience falls into the catchment area of this radio station, particularly if you're paying for the time!</li>
<li><strong>Long term projects</strong>: where the telephone numbers remain the same for longer and the content is regularly updated, you might consider advertising your number on high-turnover, affordable consumables - for example on the plastic wrapping on loaves of bread, a commodity that everyone buys on a regular and consistent basis. You might consider running a competition in conjunction with the bread manufacturer which raises your profile (and increases your coverage) and also encourages people to buy their product. This method would help reach small rural communities that congregate around the general store in their area - they might not have access to newspapers, might not be in a radio catchment area, but they will buy bread.</li>
<li><strong>Packaging:</strong> Kubatana trust printed newspaper-sized sheets used for wrapping produce by local vendors thereby disseminating information from the vendor to the person buying the product, to their home and its inhabitants and on - something similar could be used to advertise your numbers and educate your audience on using your Freedom Fone service.</li>
<li><strong>Freedom Fone itself!</strong> Once your service is up and running, you can use your own service to advertise upcoming audio changes, outreach programs or the location of relevant materials to be accessed.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: <strong>all your advertising must include a &quot;Call to Action&quot;.</strong> Example: &quot;<em>Call 077123456 to find out more</em>&quot;. In the case of a poll, you have several criteria to communicate to your audience: start and end date/time for the poll, multiple choices answers, poll code and of course the phone number to which participants should send their SMS replies.</p>
<p><em>Do you have some advertising ideas you can share with us?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Online communication</h2>
<p>Does your audience use the internet? Even if they don't - if you have access to the internet, and maybe run a website, you might want to consider the following channels for advertising and spreading general awareness about the service:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email your information to a list of contacts you have;</li>
<li>Post your information the websites and blogs of your peers;</li>
<li>Making an announcement on your website, Facebook and Twitter accounts.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Educating your audience</h2>
<p>An important step in ensuring that your audience call in and use your Freedom Fone service is to provide training to new callers. Please see the chapter <em>Know Your Audience</em> for some suggestions on how to do this.</p>
<p><span id="ch025_monitor-and-evaluate.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Monitor and evaluate</h1>
<p>Once your Freedom Fone service is up and running, it is important to keep a finger on the pulse of your service and to periodically monitor its success and impact. Freedom Fone has some inbuilt tools that can be used to track caller usage of your service. In the chapter Organise your staff, we make some recommendations about assigning the task of monitoring and analysing your system data.</p>
<p>Ways to monitor and evaluate your service:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focus group discussions:</strong> Arrange to visit communities where your audience is based and are prepared to talk about your service. This face-to-face communication can not only help you evaluate your service but also provide you with new ideas!</li>
<li><strong>SMS polls:</strong> You might like to try polling your audience with a simple closed question, such as &quot;Have you found our content useful?&quot;. This could be sent out to callers by making a voice menu explaining how to vote, sent as a bulk SMS to a list of numbers or by using one of your advertising channels.</li>
<li><strong>Competition:</strong> You might start a competition, asking your callers to submit their ideas for content, with a small prize for those interesting contributions which are implemented</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Call data records (CDR):</strong> Freedom Fone keeps track of usage statistics on all incoming calls and SMSs (see chapter on Statistics in section: &quot;Setting up&quot;).</p>
</li>
<ul>
<li><em>Number of callers</em> - You might map the number of calls at the beginning of your campaign and watch to see if they grow, you should notice peaks and troughs around advertising and education campaigns, new content, polls and competitions.</li>
<li><em>Length of calls</em> - how long your callers are staying on the line? This may indicate that your content is too long (and therefore too expensive), or not engaging enough, or technical errors and a misunderstanding of how to use the menus may also be indicated.</li>
<li><em>Popular content</em> - which content your callers are accessing, which may help identify which information they consider more useful and relevant. Contacting one-off callers might be helpful in identifying which barriers prevented them from accessing your service again.</li>
<li><em>SMS poll statistics</em> - will show how many callers participated in your poll, and the number of invalid votes will help you evaluate how successful your caller education campaign has been.</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Phone surveys:</strong> Once you have extracted and analysed your CDR stats you can create two lists of groups of audience members to survey through a simple phone call:</p>
</li>
<ul>
<li><em>Top 20 callers:</em> These are your regular customers. Try sending them an SMS and ask them if they are willing to participate in an audience survey. You can then prepare a short survey to be conducted over the phone - this will help you evaluate and refine your service, especially focusing on what people like about your service.</li>
<li><em>One time callers:</em> It is just as important to also contact people who are not using your service regularily - they only called your system once and never called back. Surveying them can help you find out how to improve your service and remove barriers to its use.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<em>What are some of your strategies for Monitoring and Evaluating your service?</em>
</blockquote>
<p><span id="ch027_logging-in.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Logging in</h1>
<p><em>Note:</em> This section assumes that you have already installed the Freedom Fone software, connected your hardware and tested your SIM cards. All these procedures can be found in the section <em>Technical Stuff.</em></p>
<p>When you open the Freedom Fone interface, you will be presented with a <em>login screen</em> which you must be authenticated before you can continue. </p>
<p>The default login details are:</p>
<p><em>User = Admin<br />
Password = thefone</em></p>
<p>To ensure a higher level of security, please change the default login details when first logging into Freedom Fone.</p>
<p>If you cannot login with these details, contact your Freedom Fone administrator for up-to-date login information.</p>
<p><span id="ch028_sms.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Incoming SMS</h1>
<p>The SMS service allows you to receive ordinary SMS messages and view them in a reader friendly interface. Through the Freedom Fone interface you can then export the SMSs into any content management service of choice. Freedom Fone does not have the functionality for you to send SMSs. There are already several tools available to send SMSs effectively and integration with one of these tools, FrontlineSMS, is on the Freedom Fone agenda for 2012.</p>
<p>A caller may send an SMS to one of the SIM cards that you have installed for your Freedom Fone service. Freedom Fone first checks to see if the SMS received begins with a keyword that has been reserved for a poll. If this is not the case, the SMS will appear in your <em>Message Centre</em> under <em>Incoming SMS</em>.</p>
<p>In <em>Message Centre &gt; Incoming SMS</em>, all SMSs are sorted by date/time that they were received, and also display the message content, time, type, and sender's number. From here, you are also able to delete single or multiple messages.</p>
<p><img src="static/sms.png" /></p>
<p><span id="ch029_polls.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Polls</h1>
<p>A simple and fast way to measure opinion on an issue is to conduct <em>SMS-based polls</em>. <em>SMS polls</em> enable your callers to respond to a structured question via an SMS response. As the SMSs arrive on the Freedom Fone system the individual SMSs are tallied and a summarized tabular output is generated. In scenarios which need urgent action but yet rely heavily on evidence-based information to take the first step, SMS polls can be a powerful and effective tool.</p>
<p> <img src="static/polls.png" /></p>
<h2>Functionality</h2>
<p>The Poll function allows end users to participate in polls by sending a SMS to Freedom Fone. The Poll functionality allows for time sensitivity, providing a start and end date/time, and multiple choices for a user to select from. The polls are available at <em>Poll &gt; Manage Polls.</em> </p>
<p>Poll details can be communicated with the public via any means, including website, email, radio and printed materials. Remember to share the above details and include the poll code and the phone number to which participants should send their SMS replies. You can refer to the chapter about advertising your service to get some ideas on how to spread the word out about your poll. </p>
<p>For each poll, once it has started, the administrator can at anytime, view the interim or final result in terms of number of votes per answer, and percentage of total votes per answer. </p>
<p>The system classifies all incoming votes as valid, invalid, or incorrect:</p>
<h3>Valid vote</h3>
<p>A vote is said to be <em>valid</em> if received with the correct <em>poll code</em> (the poll code is the unique identifier of the poll - see further) and a valid answer (the participant's answer matches one of the options given). A valid vote can be <em>in time</em>, but also <em>early</em> or <em>late</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early<br />
</strong>Received before the poll opened.</li>
<li><strong>In time<br />
</strong>Received while the poll was open.</li>
<li><strong>Late<br />
</strong>Received after the poll was closed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Early votes will be registered as “Valid, early”. The number of early votes per poll option is presented in a separate column under the View poll page. Early votes will not be added to the Total votes accepted for the poll.</p>
<p>Late votes will be registered as “Valid, late”. The number of late votes per poll option is presented in a separate column under the View poll page. Late votes will not be added to the Total votes accepted for the poll. </p>
<p>The Early and Late vote classifications are summarised separately to provide a complete view of votes submitted to the poll concerned.</p>
<h3>Invalid vote </h3>
<p>A vote will be classied as &quot;invalid&quot; if it displays the correct poll code, but a non-matching poll option (the participant used the correct poll code, but his answer was not one of the options given.)</p>
<p>Invalid votes are registered as votes, but classified as “invalid”. “Early”, “late” and “on-time” invalid votes are also registered. </p>
<p>Only “on-time” invalid votes are incorporated into the Total number of votes summary.</p>
<p>Invalid vote totals are provided to give you an idea of how SMS errors might impact on poll results.</p>
<h3>Incorrect vote</h3>
<p>Incorrect votes have a non-matching poll code.</p>
<p>Incorrect votes that cannot be matched to any existing poll, will be classified as an incoming SMS and will be stored under “Other SMS”. The SMS will be classified as “Unclassified”.</p>
<h3>Other criteria used for vote validation</h3>
<p>The poll is not sensitive to casing, so 'yes' ,'Yes', 'YES', 'yEs' will all be interpreted as a YES. The same logic applies to the poll code. More than one poll can be active at the same time. Incoming SMS are identified by the code used and matched with existing polls.</p>
<p>The timestamp used to determine whether or not a vote is in time for a poll, is the time of arrival to the Freedom Fone platform. Hence, if an SMS gets delayed in the GSM network, it will be classified as late even if it was sent before the poll deadline.</p>
<h2>Create a Poll</h2>
<p>The Freedom Fone administrator has the ability to create, edit and delete Polls. A poll is composed using the following parameters; to create a poll navigate to <em>Polls &gt; Create Poll</em> <strong></strong> and you should see the screen shown below:</p>
<p><img src="static/newPoll.png" /></p>
<p>A Poll consists of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question<br />
</strong>The question you want your audience to answer.</li>
<li><strong>Code<br />
</strong>The poll code. It cannot comprise more than 10 alphanumeric characters. This code must be included as the first word in an SMS vote participating in the poll.</li>
<li><strong>Answers<br />
</strong>Two or more answers to the question. For example the question might be &quot;Does your family make use of mosquito nets?&quot; Your valid answers would then be &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot; or &quot;Sometimes&quot;.</li>
<li><strong>Start time<br />
</strong>Date and time when the poll opens for submission.</li>
<li><strong>End time<br />
</strong>Date and time when the poll closes for submission.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: The administrator creates a poll with the following parameters:</p>
<p>Question: Would you like to deploy Freedom Fone in your organization?<br />
Code: freedomfone<br />
Answer: Yes/No/Maybe<br />
Start time: 08:00 AM, January 1, 2010<br />
End time: 08:00 AM, Jan 31, 2010</p>
<p>To participate in the poll, the end user needs to send an SMS that arrives after 08:00 AM the 1st of January, and before 08:00 AM the 31st of January 2010 with one of the following messages:</p>
<p>freedomfone yes<br />
freedomfone no<br />
freedomfone maybe</p>
<p>The administrator can at any time edit the above listed fields. Of course, it is not recommended to change the question, code or answers to a poll once it has been opened to the public. Before a poll is opened, and after it has been closed, no poll votes are registered for the poll. </p>
<p><span id="ch030_leave-a-message-lam.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Leave a message (LAM)</h1>
<p>The <em>Leave-a-message</em> or <em>LAM function</em> is an effective way of establishing two-way communication with your callers. With the <em>Leave-a-message function</em> the caller can leave a question or comment in audio form on your Freedom Fone system. Audio messages enable your callers to express themselves more freely and Freedom Fone captures those messages without loss of meaning or character. The content left by your callers can be played and listened to from the Freedom Fone interface. In addition to being a platform for leaving questions, the Leave-a-message function can be useful as an alert platform for callers to alert you on issues that need your attention. Content left by callers can also be re-used, for example you could select 5 stories submitted for a competition using LAM, re-broadcast these and allow the public to vote for their favourites.</p>
<h2>Functionality</h2>
<p>A <em>Leave-a-message</em> function can be either a part of a <em>Voice Menu</em> or it can be a stand alone service. As part of a voice menu the Leave-a-message function will be allocated a digit by the Freedom Fone administrator, which a caller can dial to access it. When the <em>Leave-a-message</em> is set up as a stand alone service, the caller will be directly connected to the service without dialing any key and they can record a message after hearing a beep and then hang up.</p>
<p><img src="static/lam_1.png" /></p>
<p>The <strong>advanced</strong> <em><strong></strong> Leave-a-message</em> service allows the caller to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Record a message</li>
<li>Listen to their recorded message</li>
<li>Delete and record a new message OR</li>
<li>Save their message and exit </li>
</ol>
<p><img src="static/LAMflow.png" /><br />
</p>
<p>By using the buttons <em># (hash), * (star), 0 (zero) and 1 (one)</em>, the user is able to navigate through the menu according to the illustration above. </p>
<p>The caller's selection after leaving a audio message determines whether the simple or advanced functionality is used by the system. If they hang up directly after leaving a audio message, the message is saved; if they press the # key after leaving their audio message, the system will await further key selections to determine what should be done with the audio message. If they fail to select 1 to save their message before hanging up (having pressed #), their audio message will be deleted.</p>
<p>Callers’ audio messages are displayed in the <em>Leave-a-message Inbox</em>.</p>
<h2>The Leave-a-message Inbox</h2>
<p>Visiting <em>Message Centre &gt; Inboxes &gt; Audio Messages</em> will provide you with access to all of the Audio Messages left in the Leave-a-message inbox. Callers’ audio messages can be titled, tagged, categorised and rated. They can also be archived if required – in <em>message edit view</em> the status field can be used for this purpose. Each audio message can be exported as an .mp3 file using the download icon <img src="static/playIcon.png" />.</p>
<p><img src="static/LamMessages.png" /></p>
<h2>Creating a Leave-a-message Menu</h2>
<p><em>Message Centre &gt; Manage LAM</em> and click on the <em>Create New</em> button<em>.</em></p>
<p><em><img src="static/newLam.png" /></em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p>If you wish to make use of the <em>Advanced Leave-a-message</em> prompts, click advanced options at the bottom of the screen, above the Save button. You will need to provide the following audio files:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Instructions</strong>: The instructions file specifies the instructions the caller has to execute to review their message.</li>
<li><strong>Invalid</strong>: The invalid-sound attribute specifies the message that is played when a caller makes an invalid entry.</li>
<li><strong>Goodbye</strong>: The Goodbye message is played when a caller makes too many invalid entries or too many timeouts occur. This file is played before disconnecting the caller. </li>
</ul>
<p>Saving this will create your Leave-a-message which can now be linked to from your Voice Menus.</p>
<p><span id="ch031_voice-menus.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Voice menus</h1>
<p><em>Voice menus</em> enable you to create an information tree which your callers can navigate through with the aid of dialing keys on a telephone keypad. You can imagine a <em>voice menu</em> as a grouping of similar content which you would like your callers to access. Each content item in your menu will be linked to a unique digit on your telephone keypad.</p>
<p>The process of embedding voice menus within existing voice menus, which we call <em>nesting</em>, allows you to extend your information tree and hence provide more content to your callers. </p>
<h2>Functionality</h2>
<p>The administrator is able to build a variety of Voice Menus based on customised audio files and synthesized text messages called content.</p>
<p>A voice menu consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Menu Instructions</em><br />
A set of mandatory voice prompts which include:</p>
</li>
<ul>
<li><em>Welcome message</em><br />
The welcome message specifies the initial greeting that is played when a caller reaches the IVR. The welcome file will be played only once when a call is first answered by the system. An example would be &quot;Thank you for calling ABC company&quot;</li>
<li><em>Instructions<br />
</em>The instructions file specifies the instructions the caller has to execute to listen to the menu options. This file will be played out to the caller repeatedly at various points of the call. An example would be &quot;For issues on domestic violence, press 1; to leave a message, press 2, ...etc&quot;. You can refer to the chapter &quot;create voice menu&quot; to get tips on how to make your instructions efficient.</li>
<li><em>Invalid<br />
</em>The invalid-sound attribute specifies the message that is played when a caller makes an invalid entry.</li>
<li><em>Goodbye<br />
</em>The Goodbye message is played when a caller makes too many invalid entries or too many timeouts occur. This file is played before disconnecting the caller.</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p><em>Menu Options</em> <strong><br />
</strong>A menu option can be made up of the following which your callers can select on the telephone to hear the content:</p>
</li>
<ul>
<li><em>Content</em></li>
<li><em>Leave a Message</em></li>
<li><em>Voice Menu</em></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><img src="static/voicemenulayout_600px.png" /> <br />
</p>
<p>The design of a Voice Menu is illustrated above. </p>
<h2>Designing a Menu</h2>
<p>When creating a <em>voice menu</em>, the best practice is to sketch out the intended structure for how you wish users to navigate your content.</p>
<pre><code>MENU 1.
WELCOME AUDIO
&quot;Welcome to Local News FM&quot;INSTRUCTIONS
&quot;To listen to info from your area, press one
 To listen to global news headlines, press two
 To leave us a message, press three&quot;  CALLER PRESSES 1.   MENU 2.
   INSTRUCTIONS
   &quot;To get traffic info, press one
    To get local weather, press two
    To return to the previous menu, press zero&quot;   CALLER PRESSES 1.
      CONTENT AUDIO
      &quot;Todays traffic....&quot;   CALLER PRESSES 2. 
      CONTENT AUDIO
      &quot;Todays weather is....&quot;    CALLER PRESSES 0.
      USER RETURNS TO PREVIOUS MENU
CALLER PRESSES 2.
   CONTENT AUDIO
   &quot;Todays global headlines are....&quot;CALLER PRESSES 3.
   CONTENT AUDIO
   &quot;Please leave us a message after the tone&quot;INVALID AUDIO
&quot;Oops, please enter a valid option&quot;GOODBYE AUDIO
&quot;Goodbye&quot;</code></pre>
<h2>Creating Content</h2>
<p>Once you have designed the structure of your menu, it is time to create the <em>audio files</em>.</p>
<p>The audio files must be uploaded in either .mp3 or .wav format through the <em>user interface</em>. They should be recorded as mono, 8Khz files, and must be less than 10MB in size. Once uploaded, they can be listened to from the administration GUI via the built-in Flashplayer. Audio files can at any time be overwritten with a new audio file.</p>
<p>Once you have created the menu instructions, record the menu options and upload them in the content section, I<em>VR Centre &gt; Content &gt; Upload.</em></p>
<p><img src="/freedomfone/_edit/static/uploadContent.png" /></p>
<p>Give your audio file a title and save.</p>
<p>When all audio content has been uploaded, you are now able to find it in <em>IVR Centre -&gt; Content.</em></p>
<p><img src="static/Content.png" /></p>
<h2>Creating the Voice Menu</h2>
<p>When creating an voice menu with sub menus, you must create all sub menus before creating their parent. This will become apparent when putting them together as you need to link to an existing menu.</p>
<p>To create a Voice Menu, follow these simple steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>You will need to create the menu structure at <em>IVR Center -&gt; Voice menus -&gt; Create New</em></li>
<li>Name the menu, and then assign the audio files you have just created to the four respective sections.</li>
<li>Within the <em>Menu Options</em> select the type you wish to appear for the assigned digits.</li>
<li>In the example above, we have to create <em>MENU 2</em> before we create <em>MENU 1.</em> When creating <em>MENU 1</em>, we can select <em>MENU 2</em> in the <em>Voice Menu</em> dropdown selection for <em>digit #1.</em> And then select the appropriate audio <em>Content</em> for <em>digit #2</em>. Finally selecting your <em>Leave a Message</em> for <em>digit #3</em> (Please see the Leave a Message chapter on how to create your Leave a Message menu).</li>
<li>Save, and you're finished! </li>
</ol>
<p>All existing <em>Voice Menus</em> will now appear in <em>IVR Center &gt; Voice menus</em></p>
<p><img src="static/VoiceMenus.png" /> </p>
<h2>Audio Files In Depth</h2>
<p>This section helps to provide you with a bit more about the audio files within Freedom Fone, and other approaches to creating menus.</p>
<p>A Menu Instruction can be generated in three ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Customised audio files</li>
<li>Customised text to speech</li>
<li>Default text to speech</li>
</ol>
<p>Customised audio files: If the administrator associates an audio file with a message, that file will be played to the caller when she enters the voice menu.</p>
<p>If an audio file has been uploaded to the voice menu, it can be exported as an .mp3 file by clicking the download icon <img src="static/playIcon.png" />.</p>
<p>Customised text to speech: If no audio file is provided for a message, but a customised text message exists, the text message will be synthesized and played to the caller.</p>
<p>If the <em>voice menu</em> includes one or more text prompts in the place of audio files AND you are NOT using a licensed copy of the default <em>Cepstral</em> voice, you will hear an automated voice play before each text prompt is synthesized, reminding you to buy a license. If you use your own audio files you do not need to use text to speech at all.</p>
<p>A license for the Allison 8 Khz voice for Linux can be bought from <em>https://www.cepstral.com/</em>. Once you get the license you can register the voice by running the swift executable from the command prompt as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a terminal window by clicking the terminal icon in the centre of the title bar at the top of your screen.</li>
<li>If you are prompted to do so, enter the password you have set in the installation.</li>
<li>At the prompt type</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>/opt/swift/bin/swift --reg-voice</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Follow the instructions to enter the details associated with your license. You will be asked for Name, Organisation and License key</li>
</ul>
<p>Default text to speech: If neither an audio file, nor a customised text is provided, the default text will be synthesized and played to the caller.</p>
<p>A Menu option file can be used in one or more different <em>Voice Menus</em>. These files cannot be deleted if they are currently associated with a Voice Menu. The administrator can at any time add, edit or delete a <em>Voice Menu</em>. The administrator can create multiple Voice Menus and all can be active at the same time. <em>Freedom Fone v.2.S</em> offers the possibility to assign eight Menu Options to a Voice Menu. It is possible to link voice menus such that a menu option can lead to another voice menu which in turn gives more options to a caller.</p>
<p>Note that digits 0 and 9 are reserved for navigation.</p>
<p><span id="ch032_security.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Security</h1>
<p>Telephony is inherently insecure - carriers (Mobile Network Operators) maintain call data records of phone call and SMS traffic on their networks. This enables authorities to monitor the phone numbers accessing a Freedom Fone Service and to scrutinise the contents of SMS messages.</p>
<p>Greater risk to caller privacy is more likely to be found inside your own organisation since sensitive information about your callers is recorded by Freedom Fone, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phone numbers</strong> are displayed for Incoming SMS and Voice messages received via the Leave-a-Message function</li>
<li><strong>Callers' content choices</strong> and activity is revealed in system data and Call Data Records</li>
<li><strong>Phone books</strong> can be used to associate a personal profile for callers' numbers</li>
<li><strong>Export buttons</strong> allow pretty much all of the data to be exported from Freedom Fone in one form or another.</li>
</ul>
<p>To help you limit which of your staff can view and export sensitive data, there is a basic <em>Role Based Access Control</em> in the Freedom Fone's user interface. All users of the system must enter a username and password in a <em>login screen</em>.</p>
<p>For some organisations, there are very real concerns that their Freedom Fone server might be seized by hostile agents with the skills to bypass basic security, potentially compromising their callers. In recognition of this possibility, Freedom Fone's logging architecture has been reorganised to allow sensitive data to be stored in an encrypted drive and/or on removable media. For more information about using this service contact us - refer to the chapter <em>Support</em></p>
<p>For environments where security is a concern the <em>sweeper</em> is a useful feature which allows you to replace sensitive data that is visible with dummy data. Such information includes caller phone numbers, names, email addresses, Skype id's and organisational names. The security feature will remove these from all user interfaces and log files.</p>
<p>The sweeper functions should be used with care as it is irreversible and will render many of the usage reports meaningless. For advanced users, the <em>Backend Sweeper</em> can be configured to periodically purge sensitive information from Freedom Fone.</p>
<h2>Frontend Sweeper</h2>
<p>The <em>Frontend GUI Sweeper</em> is a panic button that is used to replace all caller identity information with arbitrary values. It is only accessible for Admin system users through the main menu <em>(User Management &gt; Frontend Sweeper</em>). It is important to note that once you have run the <em>Frontend sweeper</em> it is not possible for you to view or reverse the process. It is advised that you have a system in place to regularly backup your data.</p>
<h3>Running the Frontend sweeper</h3>
<p>Navigate to <em>User Management &gt; Frontend Sweeper</em></p>
<p>When you select the Frontend Sweeper button you are brought to the screen shown below.</p>
<p><img src="static/Front_end_sweeper.png" /></p>
<p>Click on the <em>Start Sweeper</em> button and all personally identifiable information associated with the records in the Call Detail Records, Monitoring, Reporting, Statistics and Phone book details will be replaced. The screen shot below shows how the callers' numbers associated with the call data records are replaced with 555666.</p>
<p><img src="static/Call_Data_Records.png" /></p>
<p>The screen shot below shows how the contact details in your Phone books are anonymized by the sweeper, replacing name, surname and email with John Doe as the caller.</p>
<p><img src="static/callers.png" /></p>
<h2>Backend Sweeper</h2>
<p>The <em>Backend GUI Sweeper</em> is a service that runs behind the scenes to remove caller records and logs from the system at regular intervals. It is accessible to anyone with root access to the machine, and is automatically run by means of a <em>cronjob</em>. The <em>Backend GUI Sweeper</em> is not enabled by default (<em>cron/crontab</em>). The <em>Backend Sweeper</em> will periodically, depending on settings, purge sensitive information from Freedom Fone.</p>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>The Backend sweeper is configured in the file <em>config/gui_config_sweeper.php</em> </p>
<p>The following parameters can be configured: </p>
<ol>
<li>Enable/disable Frontend sweepers<br />
<em>Values: 0 or 1</em><br />
Comment: Enable GUI sweepers by setting value to 1.<br />
Disable GUI sweepers by setting value to 0.</li>
<li>Sweeper mode<br />
<em>Values: low or high</em><br />
Comment: &quot;low&quot; mode will only sweep phone numbers, while &quot;high&quot; mode will also sweep callers names, surnames, email, Skype and organisational names.</li>
<li>Fallback data<br />
The fallback values (after sweeping) of callers numbers, names etc. can be configured under <em>SWEEP_SETTINGS</em>. The default value for caller's name is for example &quot;John Doe&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Core Sweeper</h2>
<p>The Core Sweeper handles the following operations (none of them is enabled by default as a <em>cronjob</em>):</p>
<ol>
<li>Sweeps audio meta data of MP3 and WAV files<br />
Documentation: <em>sweeper/INSTALL.sweeper.metadata</em></li>
<li>Extra log information<br />
The script <em>sweeper/sweeper.sh</em> allows a user to re-configure the system to disable <em>syslog, mail, webserver and telephony logs</em>. The script replaces the configuration file of iwatch, apache2, freeswitch to disable logging.<br />
Documentation/Script: <em>sweeper/sweeper.sh</em></li>
<li>Delete all logs<br />
All logs are stored under <em>/opt/freedomfone/log</em>. The script sweeper/sweeper.sh will prompt to delete all logs. Alternatively a <em>cron job</em> can be created to delete the logs periodically.<br />
The function <em>delete_logs()</em> in the script shows how to stop and start the services. </li>
</ol>
<p><span id="ch033_statistics.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Statistics</h1>
<p>The power of Freedom Fone statistics is that they will capture every detail from the time a caller dials your number to the point at which they end the call. They offer more insight into the information needs of your callers and can be useful in coming up with a content strategy.</p>
<p>It is highly recommended that you do not work directly on the Freedom Fone server to view Call Data Record reports and graphs. These activities require intensive database activity that will slow down performance on the server. Whenever possible, rather access the Freedom Fone server from another computer using your local area network. </p>
<p>Statistics can be exported as a <em>CSV</em> file for a refined analysis or for building graphs, for example using our Graphic Reporting Tool (described later in this chapter) or a spreadsheet tool like Excel.</p>
<p>The statistics come under the <em>System Data</em> menu and consists of 4 sections.</p>
<h2>Call Data Records</h2>
<p>Call data records, commonly abbreviated as CDR, detail when a call starts and when it ends. The CDR also records when a <em>SMS</em> and a <em>Poll</em> lands. The IVR menu or LAM that a caller accesses is also reflected in the CDR. The administrator can choose to export All entries, or a range of entries using a start and end time. The screen shot below shows an example of a CDR page. To see the CDR page navigate to <em>System Data &gt; Call Data Records</em><strong>:</strong></p>
<p><img src="static/Call_Data_Records.png" /></p>
<p>The <em>CS_ROUTING</em> label under the &quot;Type&quot; column indicates the start of a call and the <em>CS_DESTROY</em> indicates the end of a call. each call has a unique Call ID which is generated by the system. For every call there are two entries,one indicates the start and the other the end.</p>
<h2>Statistics</h2>
<p>The <em>statistics page</em> gives a summarised view of all the activities that are happening within your system. The view of the statistics page is similar to the overview section of the home page, the difference being that on the statistics page you can select a date and time range to view statistics. To view the statistics page navigate to <em>System Data &gt; Statistics</em>. The screen below shows the statistics page.It is not possible to export this page.</p>
<p><img src="static/CDR_statistics.png" /></p>
<h2>Monitoring</h2>
<p>Freedom Fone offers the administrator a means to monitor the features accessed by callers via a voice menu. For each incoming call to a <em>Voice Menu</em>, the caller's options are recorded (time, ivr, digit pressed, menu option chosen, caller number). These call records can be exported to a CSV file. The administrator can choose to export All entries, or a range of entries using a start and end time. To view the monitoring page, select <em>System Data &gt; Monitoring. </em>The screen shot below shows the monitoring page:</p>
<p><img src="static/Monitoring.png" /></p>
<p>Entries that relate to a Leave-a-message will only reflect in the monitoring section if the leave-a-message is an option of a voice menu. </p>
<h2>Reporting</h2>
<p>The reporting page shows the call duration for the calls made to either your voice menu or your leave a message service. You are able to select a date range for which you want to view either your voice menus or leave a message service. The administrator can choose to export all entries, or a range of entries using a start and end time. To access the reporting page, select <em>System Data &gt; Reporting. </em>The screen shot below shows the reporting interface:</p>
<p><img src="static/Reporting.png" /></p>
<h2>Graphic Reporting Tool</h2>
<p>The Graphic Reporting Tool enables you to output graphical representations of the data from your call detail records. This tool can be of great value for presentations, and for simplifying and making sense of, the call statistics you get on your machine.</p>
<p>First, you need to export the data you wish to show in your graph. To do this, go to <em>System Data &gt; Reporting,</em> select the search parameters according to the information you wish to present - choose the relevant dates and service. Click on the <em>export</em> button and ensure that only the <em>comma</em> check box is selected in the export attributes of the CSV file. Choose the location for the export file and save.</p>
<p>To access the graphic reporting tool, open a new tab and into the address bar of the browser, type in the following URL:</p>
<p>a) If you are working on the Freedom Fone server:</p>
<p>http://localhost/reporting</p>
<p>b) If you are accessing the Freedom Fone server across the LAN:</p>
<p>http://your FF server IP address/reporting</p>
<p>e.g. http://192.168.1.250/reporting<br />
</p>
<p>After entering the URL above, you should get the following screen:</p>
<p><br />
<img src="static/Step1_reporting.png" /><br />
</p>
<p>Using the <em>Browse</em> button, navigate to the CSV file you have exported from Freedom Fone.  Click the <em>Upload</em> button to view the page below:<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/Uploaded_data.png" /><br />
</p>
<p>Select the menu(s) and date ranges you want included in the graphs and give the report a title. Click on the <em>Generate Report</em> button and a new report should be generated with various graphical output, as illustrated by the screens below:</p>
<p><img src="static/At_a_glance_reporting.png" /><br />
</p>
<p>Use the buttons on the left hand side of this page to view different graphical representations of your data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cumulative Menus display call data records totaled over time.</li>
<li>Unique Menus detail calls per time period selected ie total calls per day/week/month</li>
<li>Unique Vs Total differentiates between unique callers and the number of calls they make</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="static/call_length.png" /><br />
</p>
<p>This data can be exported and printed.</p>
<p><span id="ch034_user-management.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>User management</h1>
<h2>System users</h2>
<p>Freedom Fone version 2S adds the functionality of multi users with different access levels.</p>
<p>The system administrator has unrestricted access to all the system modules. You can have many users with administrative rights, the same applies to the non-admin users.</p>
<p>To add a user simply navigate to <em>User management &gt; System Users</em> and click on the <em>Add user</em> button shown in the screen below.</p>
<p><img src="static/System_users.png" /></p>
<p>When you click the <em>Add user</em> button you are prompted to create a new user: assign a username and password of your choice to the new user and lastly assign the new user with either Admin or non-Admin rights using the group option. The image below shows the interface for adding a new user. </p>
<p><img src="static/Add_user.png" /></p>
<p>Click on the <em>Save</em> button. You can see that the new user had been created.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span id="ch035_callers-and-phone-books.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Phone books</h1>
<h2>Creating Phone books</h2>
<p>Phone books can be used to segment your callers, for example for different calling campaigns.</p>
<h2>Adding Callers to your Phone book</h2>
<p>You can populate your phone book in Edit mode.  Select one or more callers from the dropdown list displayed and save.  Alternatively you can add callers to the phone book from the <em>User Management &gt; Callers page</em>.<br />
</p>
<h2>Removing a Caller from a Phone book</h2>
<p>Do not select the delete option as this will remove all instances of that caller, including from the caller's list!</p>
<p>You may remove a user in two ways:</p>
<p>Edit phone book (and uncheck the caller) or,</p>
<p>Edit caller (and uncheck the phone book).</p>
<h2>Export Phone book</h2>
<p>You can export your phone book(s) to a CSV file by selecting the <em>Export</em> icon associated with it.<br />
</p>
<p><span id="ch036_callers.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Callers</h1>
<h2>Adding a caller</h2>
<p>You can manually add a caller by selecting the <em>Add Caller</em> button on the User Management &gt; Callers page.<br />
</p>
<p>On the User Management &gt; Callers &gt; Edit page you can edit caller details and view caller's activity and details.<br />
</p>
<p><span id="ch038_technical-requirements.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Technical requirements</h1>
<p>Freedom Fone was built as a DIY (do it yourself) tool which you should have up and running before you finish saying &quot;Freedom Fone&quot;. There are a few technical requirements you have to satisfy before you start using Freedom Fone. The requirements stated below are only given as a guideline. You may see the need to increase your equipment specifications depending on the amount of calls you expect to average.</p>
<h2>Evaluation equipment required</h2>
<p>If you wish to evaluate Freedom Fone beyond experimenting with our online demo <a href="http://demo.freedomfone.org">(http://demo.freedomfone.org)</a>, we have successfully installed on low end/low cost computers for non-critical demonstration and evaluation purposes.</p>
<p>An example minimum specification of a computer that is able to run this version of Freedom Fone:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Computer Model:</strong> Asus Eeepc 900HD<strong><br />
Processor:</strong> Intel Celeron M 900MHz <strong><br />
RAM:</strong> 1GB<strong><br />
Hard Drive:</strong> 10GB <strong><br />
Optical Drive:</strong> DVD Reader </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please note: if you wish to install Freedom Fone to test you should do so on a machine which contains no important data as the installer will wipe your hard disk and install both the Ubuntu Operating system and Freedom Fone. As an alternative, you can choose to install Freedom Fone into another partition on your computer's hard drive. Freedom Fone's installer DVD will give you an opportunity to choose between overwriting the entire hard drive and installing alongside your current system.</p>
<h2>Recommended equipment required</h2>
<p>When it comes to implementing your Freedom Fone service in a live environment, it is highly recommended that you use a more powerful system. The following is a recommended standard set up:</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Processor:</strong> Dual Core Processor (Intel or AMD) &gt;2.0GHz <br />
<strong>Sound:</strong> Onboard soundcard<br />
<strong>RAM:</strong> 2GB<br />
<strong>Hard Drive:</strong> 80GB<br />
<strong>Optical Drive:</strong> DVD Reader<br />
<strong>GSM device:</strong> 2N OfficeRoute (takes 4 SIM cards) <strong>or</strong> Eurodesign MobiGater (takes 1 SIM card)<br />
<strong>Signal:</strong> Good GSM signal coverage<br />
<strong>Power:</strong> Reliable backup power
</blockquote>
<p>See the <em>Equipment</em> <strong></strong> chapter for details of suppliers of OfficeRoute and MobiGater devices.</p>
<p>Note: Freedom Fone does not run on Macintosh hardware. </p>
<p>The schematic diagrams below shows the different configurations you can have with equipment listed above.</p>
<p><img src="static/tech1_600px.png" /><br />
</p>
<p>The diagram above shows how you would connect a computer running Freedom Fone to an OfficeRoute. Note that you can also connect the OfficeRoute directly to your Freedom Fone computer using a crossover cable.</p>
<p><img src="static/tech2revised_600px.png" /><br />
</p>
<p>The diagram above shows how to connect to the MobiGater.</p>
<p><span id="ch039_installing-the-software.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Installing the software</h1>
<p>As a start, whether you just want to try and evaluate Freedom Fone or install it for good, the first step for you is to get a proper Freedom Fone installation DVD. For that, you can either download the software as an ISO file from the Freedom Fone website <a href="http://www.freedomfone.org/downloads">www.freedomfone.org/downloads</a> or, if you have bandwidth constraints, you can request the DVD to be sent to you directly by Freedom Fone. Just send an email to info@freedomfone.org!</p>
<p>If you choose to download the software, you need to burn your Freedom Fone installation DVD. To do so, remember that ISO files are disk image files: do NOT try and 'file copy' the image directly to a DVD - it must be written as an image file to the DVD. Use the <em>Record a disc from disc image</em> feature from your disc burning software. </p>
<p>... Got it?</p>
<h2>Getting Started...</h2>
<p>Note: before you start using the DVD, we recommend you back up your computer as a common security procedure.</p>
<p>Once you have your Freedom Fone installation DVD, just insert it into the DVD drive of your computer and reboot your machine. The system will boot from DVD and the screen below will appear, displaying different options you have to get started with Freedom Fone:</p>
<p><img src="static/remastersys-boot.png" width="529" height="435" /></p>
<h3>Evaluating Freedom Fone</h3>
<p>If you only wish to play around with Freedom Fone, without installing the software, just do not do anything when the above screen pops up. The LiveCD option is the default option and it will automatically go into live mode - you might have heard someone mention &quot;running a system live&quot;: this simply means running the software from the installation media - such as a CD/DVD - without installing it on your hard drive.</p>
<p>You can then play with the Freedom Fone interface in the live mode, and when you are done shutdown and eject the DVD.</p>
<p>Please always remember that the LiveCD option does <strong>not</strong> install Freedom Fone permanently to the hard drive.</p>
<h3>Installing Freedom Fone</h3>
<p>To install Freedom Fone, select the option which lets you install on your hard drive: <em>install - start the installer directly</em> and press the <em>Enter</em> key. Then follow the steps below.</p>
<p>This procedure will install both the Ubuntu Operating system and Freedom Fone on your computer.</p>
<p>Important warning: remember that Freedom Fone is a system replacer which requires a dedicated computer; the installation will erase from your hard disk your existing operating system, together with all your data. Make sure you have backed up your important data before you start the installation procedure.</p>
<h2>Install Procedure</h2>
<p>Please note that during the installation process, the system might take some time to move on between each screen; this depends on the hardware specifications of your computer. </p>
<h3><em><strong>SCREEN 1</strong></em></h3>
<p>The first screen that comes up prompts you to select the language to use during installation. </p>
<p>English is the language selected by default, but you might want to choose another one. Do so, and press <em>Enter</em> or <em>Forward</em>.</p>
<h3><em><strong>SCREEN 2</strong></em></h3>
<p>The next screen you'll get to see is the location map.</p>
<p>Select your location, either from the map or using the pull down menu. Press <em>Forward</em>.</p>
<h3><em><strong>SCREEN 3</strong></em></h3>
<p>This screen is for your keyboard layout.</p>
<p>Select the option that suits you best, and Press <em>Forward</em>.</p>
<h3><em><strong>SCREEN 4</strong></em></h3>
<p>The next screen allows you to choose whether you want to install Freedom Fone on the entire hard drive or side by side with another operating system that may be on your PC already. <strong>We strongly discourage that you install Freedom Fone side by side with another operating system for a live deployment.</strong> For demonstration purposes you may do so but this is a complex process which requires specific knowledge about computer partitioning. Only for advanced users!</p>
<p>For now, select the Erase <em>and</em> <em>use the entire disk</em> option. </p>
<p>Remember that this will erase all that is on your hard disk, including the operating system. If you have not saved your data at this stage, select the &quot;<em>Quit</em>&quot; button to quit the installation process and restart from the beginning of the procedure after you have cleared up your computer.</p>
<p>Otherwise, press <em>Forward</em>.</p>
<h3><em><strong>SCREEN 5</strong></em></h3>
<p>After selecting to use the entire disk, you are taken to the next screen which prompts you to set up your user name and password, and name your computer:</p>
<ol>
<li>Type in your name <strong></strong> and the username <strong></strong> you want to use each time you log onto Freedom Fone.</li>
<li>Take time to select a solid password as your system may carry information that could be a security concern if accessed by unauthorised users.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>keep it unique (only for your Freedom Fone access)</li>
<li>make it long and complex enough so that it is difficult to guess</li>
<li>You might alternate numbers and letters or special characters for your password, while finding a trick to remember it - example: WATER4mydog.</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p>Set the name of your PC making sure that the name you choose does not include any spaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For <strong></strong> log-in options, we recommend that you choose the option <em>require a password to log in</em> for security reasons.</p>
</li>
<p>Press <em>Forward</em>.</p>
<h3><em><strong>SCREEN 6</strong></em></h3>
<p>This will only be seen in the case of side-by-side installations.</p>
<h3><em><strong>SCREEN 7</strong></em></h3>
<p>The last screen will complete the installation.</p>
<p>Make sure you are happy with all the choices you made on the previous screens (language, login name...). If you are not, press <em>Back</em> and repeat the steps 1 to 6 above. Otherwise, press <em>Install</em>.</p>
<p>The actual installation process begins. The installation may take a while depending on the hardware specifications of your machine.  </p>
<p>Once installation is completed, the system will automatically eject your DVD and you will be prompted to restart your system.</p>
<h2>Logging in</h2>
<p>After restarting, here is what you will see:</p>
<p><img src="static/Ubuntu_login_1.png" /></p>
<p>Occasionally Ubuntu might fail to restart the first time after installation. If this is the case, just manually reset your machine, and it should reboot successfully. At the log in prompt, enter the user name and password you have set in the installation process.</p>
<p>After logging into Ubuntu, click on the Freedom Fone icon on the desktop to launch the Freedom Fone administration page. Freedom Fone version 2.S comes with a login screen to restrict access to unauthorised users.</p>
<p>The default username and password <strong></strong> are as follows and can be changed later through the User management interface</p>
<blockquote>
User name: Admin<br />
Password:   thefone<br />
<strong></strong>

<p>Once you have successfully logged in you can move on to the next chapter <span>Preparing SIM cards</span> before you set up your GSM device(s).</p>
<p><span id="ch040_preparing-sim-cards.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Preparing SIM cards</h1>
<p>SIM cards provide Freedom Fone with access to the mobile network, allowing callers to reach your platform in the same way that they are used to reaching each other.</p>
<p>This chapter will explain how to choose your carrier(s) (Mobile Network Operator), how to prepare your SIMs for use within the GSM device, and how to install the SIMs.</p>
<h2>Choosing a Carrier &amp; Procurement</h2>
<p>Choosing a carrier is a very important step in providing callers with access to your Freedom Fone service. There are a number of obvious items you may consider as well as some that are not immediately apparent.</p>
<h3>Confirm that DTMF works on your Carrier</h3>
<p>The most important first step is to confirm that Freedom Fone works with your carrier.</p>
<p>DTMF is a high pitched sound that a phone makes when a key is pressed.  The Voice menu function of Freedom Fone depends on these DTMF tones for a caller to make a selection inside a Voice menu ie: <em>To hear market prices, press two</em>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately some mobile phone operators do not support the use of DTMF and the Freedom Fone hardware cannot hear when a user presses a button to make a selection. To quickly check if a carrier support DTMF, try making a call between two phones on this network and in the middle of the call try pressing some buttons 1 2 3 etc. If you can hear the beeps and tones of the keypresses, the network supports DTMF. If you dont hear any tones - there are several things you can do.</p>
<p>We have had cases where it is simply a matter of trying a different SIM card from the same mobile carrier - try a few different SIMs. If that still does not work, you can test further by calling the default Cholera menu after you have installed the Freedom Fone software.</p>
<p>If you are still unable to get the Freedom Fone service to respond to keypresses you could try speaking to the technical support people at the carrier - otherwise you may need to consider using a different carrier.  Note: All is not lost - you may still use functions that do not require caller key press selections such as the Leave-a-message function or create a single informational Voice menu that a caller can listen to.</p>
<h3>Cost from your perspective</h3>
<p>Which carriers are the cheapest to receive calls? In some countries, inbound calls are billable.</p>
<p>Which carriers offer the best SMS rates? This may include bundles that can be bolted on to your service plan to offer discounted volume rates.</p>
<h3>Cost from the caller's perspective</h3>
<p>Which carriers are your callers on? Cross network calls are often more expensive than same network communication.</p>
<p>Discounted call times or promotions? Are there any discounts or promotions that you can take advantage of from a mobile carrier?</p>
<p>Sometimes, offering a choice for callers to access your service through multiple carriers will increase the likelihood that they will call. Remember to advertise all your numbers and carriers to help callers make the appropriate choice.</p>
<h3>Network Reception at Freedom Fone Service Location</h3>
<p>Check to see which carriers offer the best reception at the physical location of your Freedom Fone service. The better the signal, the higher the quality of call.</p>
<h3>Network Reception at Caller's Location</h3>
<p>If targeting a specific audience based on geography, ensure that the carrier of choice also has reception in that location.</p>
<h3>Selecting MSISDN (Mobile Number)</h3>
<p>If purchasing multiple SIM cards, try to get telephone numbers that are consecutive or highly memorable.Many mobile phone operators will let you choose these numbers.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>Never forget that carriers maintain call data records. In some sensitive environments, security issues and the trust you have in the carrier might guide your choice. </p>
<h2>SIM Card Preparation</h2>
<p>Before installing a SIM card into the GSM device you plan to use, ensure that you follow these simple steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Insert SIM into a mobile phone</li>
<li>Verify the following:</li>
</ol>
<p>All PIN requests on the SIM have been removed: this is usually found in a &quot;Security&quot; option within &quot;Settings&quot; on most handsets</p>
<ul>
<li>There is good carrier coverage</li>
<li>The SIM is active and has been registered: test by calling the SIM, and sending and receiving an SMS</li>
<li>It is topped up with airtime and it meets the pay-as-you-go operational requirements specific to your country</li>
<li>Delete all SMSs that exist on the SIM. This will ensure that the SIM is not full and therefore unable to receive new messages. This is usually an option within the SMS/Messaging application on most handsets.</li>
</ul>
<h2>SIM Card Installation</h2>
<p>It's now time to place the SIM(s) into the GSM device that you have chosen to use. Please follow the instructions of that specific device; to understand how to do this, see chapters the <em>Connecting OfficeRoute</em> or <em>Connecting MobiGater</em> depending on your hardware.</p>
<p><span id="ch041_connecting-officeroute.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Connecting a 2N OfficeRoute</h1>
<p><img src="static/OR1.png" /></p>
<h2>Setup via web browser</h2>
<p>The 2N® OfficeRoute is a GSM gateway that can be connected to Freedom Fone to enable you to receive calls and SMSs. After installing Freedom Fone on your computer you can proceed to configure the OfficeRoute. We recommend using a crossover cable and configuring the OfficeRoute using the Firefox browser installed on your Freedom Fone server.</p>
<p>The OfficeRoute can also be configured using a computer running Windows, a USB cable and the Windows utility provided on the CD with your equipment. </p>
<h3>Before you begin:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have a crossover cable</li>
<li>Use your mobile phone to disable the PIN code request for all the SIM cards you intend to use, before inserting them in the OfficeRoute</li>
<li>Locate the <em>office_route</em> folder on the desktop of the computer where you installed Freedom Fone. Inside the folder you will find an archive with a filename similar to <em>backup_officeroute_2.3.11.tgz</em>. The name will change depending on the OfficeRoute firmware version to be uploaded.<br />
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Setting Up</h3>
<p>Be careful to not let the SIM card fall into the OfficeRoute - this can happen when you insert the card between the chassis and the gap (these can be removed by carefully balancing the OfficeRoute or opening with a screwdriver).</p>
<ul>
<li>While the OfficeRoute is switched off, insert your SIM cards into the bays at the front of the device.<br />
SIM cards should be inserted into the top slots (SIM2 and SIM1) with corner into the chassis and chip-side down. Sim cards should be inserted into the bottom slots (SIM4 and SIM3) with corner into the chassis and chip-side up. Push until the SIM cards click into place. Pushing them gently is also how you remove the SIM cards. Do not remove or insert SIM cards when the OfficeRoute is switched on.</li>
<li>Connect the crossover cable to the ethernet point on the OfficeRoute and connect the other end of the crossover cable to the computer running Freedom Fone. </li>
<li>Attach the aerial<br />
</li>
<li>Attach power cable, plug your OfficeRoute in and turn it on; note that when you first power on the OfficeRoute, it takes a few minutes to boot as it cycles through checking the SIM cards<br />
</li>
<li>Using the Firefox browser on the Freedom Fone server enter the default IP address of the OfficeRoute, <em>192.168.1.1</em> ; if it does not work, try <em>192.168.1.46</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>1. Configuration Wizard</h2>
<p>If you are connecting to the 2N® OfficeRoute gateway for the first time or after a factory reset, the configuration wizard should appear.</p>
<p> <br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/OfficeRoute1_1_1.png" /><br />
</p>
<h3>Finish</h3>
<p>That’s all we need to do for now, so select <em>Finish</em> from the menu on the left hand side and exit the configuration wizard. In order for Freedom Fone to accept calls from the OfficeRoute and direct them to the Voice menus you have created, you will need to modify the default configuration settings on the OfficeRoute.</p>
<p><img src="static/OfficeRoute2_2.png" /><br />
</p>
<h2>2. Modifying settings via web browser</h2>
<h3>2a. Login</h3>
<p>Now that the initial wizard configuration is completed, you can configure all the OfficeRoute parameters using the web browser interface. To establish connection with the OfficeRoute, enter the default IP address <em>192.168.1.1</em> of the OfficeRoute into the browser bar (if it does not work, try <em>192.168.1.46</em>). After entering the IP address you should see a screen prompting you for a “Username” and “Password”. Username and Password are case sensitive.</p>
<p><strong>Username:</strong> <em>Admin</em><br />
<strong>Password:</strong> <em>2n</em></p>
<p>Press the login icon.</p>
<p><img src="static/OfficeRoute3_1.png" /><br />
</p>
<h3>2b. Clearing the browser’s cache</h3>
<p>Sometimes your browser will not allow you to enter the <em>Username</em> and <em>Password</em>, instead it will keep redisplaying the <em>Username</em> it has cached in memory.</p>
<p>For Firefox users:<br />
From the Firefox main menu select <strong></strong> <em>Edit &gt; Preferences</em><br />
Under Security ensure that the option to remember passwords for sites is off.</p>
<p>Under Privacy clear all history, including the cache.<br />
Refresh the login page and the <em>Username</em> should now be blank.</p>
<h3>2c. License</h3>
<p>After a successful login, the network information page of OfficeRoute configuration application is displayed. You can return to this page at any time by selecting the <em>Network</em> tab at the top of the page.</p>
<p>On this page (see screenshot below) take note of the lines with the following settings:</p>
<p><strong>“SIP”</strong> - adjacent to this the value should be <em>Enabled</em></p>
<p><strong>“Expires (hours)</strong>” - adjacent to this the value should be <em>Unlimited</em> or <em>Never</em></p>
<p><strong>“SNMP”</strong> adjacent to this the value should be <em>Enabled</em></p>
<p>If for any reason the three parameters have different values assigned to them please contact the dealer who supplied you with the equipment and request an unlimited licence with SNMP and POP enabled.</p>
<h3>Uploading a licence to your OfficeRoute</h3>
<p>If you have to request a licence from your supplier, it will be supplied in the form of a .key file. To upload the licence to your OfficeRoute, select the <em>Administration</em> tab at the top of the page. Select <em>Upload licence</em> from the menu on the left hand side. Use the browse button to locate and upload the key file provided by your supplier.</p>
<p><img src="static/OfficeRoute4_1.png" /><br />
</p>
<p>Also on the network information page, check to see that the firmware version running on your OfficeRoute is the latest available from 2N.</p>
<p>At the time of writing this guide the current firmware version is 2.3.13. You can view the firmware version under the <em>System information</em> section - check for the line which displays <em>Version</em>. If the version of firmware you are running is old you should download the latest from the 2n website: <em>http://www.2n.cz/en/products/umts/officeroute/downloads/</em></p>
<p><img src="static/Officeroute5_1.png" /><br />
</p>
<h3>2d. Upgrading Firmware</h3>
<p>You can skip this section if you are running the current firmware version. Once you are done downloading the firmware, select the <em>Administration</em> tab at the top of the page. The page shown below should be displayed.</p>
<p><img src="static/Officeroute6_1.png" /><br />
</p>
<p>Select <em>Update firmware</em> from the menu on the left hand side and using the browse function navigate to your newly downloaded file, select it and click save from the options in the bottom right hand corner of the screen.</p>
<p>The loading process will start and should take about 5 minutes...be patient! Thereafter the OfficeRoute will reboot and you will be required to log in again. Once you are logged in, check to see that the version number has changed on the screen displayed. If not, repeat the upgrading firmware instructions.</p>
<h3>2e. Synchronizing Time</h3>
<p>In order for your call data records to be accurate you will need to synchronize the time of the OfficeRoute to that of the Freedom Fone server.</p>
<p>Select the <em>Administration</em> tab at the top of the page. Then select <em>Synchronize time</em> from the menu on the LHS of screen. A screen showing the time on the OfficeRoute and the time on the Freedom Fone server will be displayed. Click on the synchronize button to set the OfficeRoute time to the time of the Freedom Fone server.</p>
<h3>2f. Uploading the backup file</h3>
<p>Select the <em>Administration</em> tab at the top of the page. Then select <em>Configuration backup</em> from the menu on the LHS of screen. A submenu will be displayed beneath <em>Configuration backup</em>. Select <em>Upload config</em>. Browse for the backup file you found on the Freedom Fone desktop (look for a filename similar to <em>backup_officeroute_2.3.11.tgz</em>) and upload the file by clicking on the <em>Upload</em> icon. The process will take about 5 minutes after which the system will reboot.</p>
<p><img src="static/OfficeRoute7_1.png" /><br />
</p>
<p>After rebooting, the OfficeRoute will have the new default settings required for operation with Freedom Fone. The default IP address that Freedom Fone assigns to the OfficeRoute is <em>192.168.1.46</em>. Hence, after uploading the backup file the IP address of the OfficeRoute will no longer be <em>192.168.1.1</em>. To login again, you will need to enter <em>192.168.1.46</em> in your browser bar to access the OfficeRoute.</p>
<h3>2g. Normalisation</h3>
<p>The OfficeRoute can apply rules to the prefix of the incoming caller ID string (phone number) – allowing you to modify the OfficeRoute to work with phone number formats used in your country. The reason for this is to maintain consistency in the format of your call data records. Operators insert different prefixes at the start of the caller IDs (phone numbers) e.g. + or 00.</p>
<p>In order for your call records to be uniform regardless of the operator from which the call originates, it may be necessary to change the normalization settings. To do this select the <em>Telephony Services</em> tab at the top of the page. Next select <em>GSM routing</em> from the menu displayed on the LHS and <em>Normalisation</em> from the submenu that is subsequently displayed beneath <em>GSM routing</em>.</p>
<p>The screenshot below shows an example of normalization settings. In this example, any incoming caller ID number which begins with the pattern +420 will have +420 removed and a zero inserted at the beginning of the number.</p>
<p><img src="static/OfficeRoute8.png" /></p>
<p>The <em>Remove count</em> specifies from which point of the prefix the OfficeRoute should start removing digits. A remove count of zero means characters will be stripped from the start of the prefix value. In the example above, all digits in the specified prefix, starting from +, will be removed and a zero (0) be prefixed to the remaining number. In this case, the country code (+420) is removed and a zero (0) inserted to make up the local area code.<br />
</p>
<h3>2h. Routing calls to Voice Menus</h3>
<p>If you have followed all the steps above, you should be able to make a phone call to a SIM card previously inserted into the OfficeRoute, and have it answered by Freedom Fone’s default <em>IVR menu</em>. Note that the <em>default IVR menu</em> is assigned a service number of 4100.</p>
<p>By default the SIM card in slot #4 (GSM module - 4 in screenshot below) is configured to direct all incoming calls on this number directly to the Leave-a-message with service 2100. If you wish to change this setting so that SIM #4 points to your Voice menu [4100], you can change this by following the instructions below</p>
<p>After you’ve created your own Freedom Fone voice menus, you will want to redirect incoming calls via the OfficeRoute to service numbers associated with these menus (Freedom Fone voice menu service numbers are displayed on the <em>IVR centre</em> &gt; <em>Voice menu</em> page). To do this select the <em>Telephony services</em> tab at the top of the page. Next select <em>GSM routing</em> from the menu displayed on the LHS and <em>GSM</em> from the submenu that is subsequently displayed beneath <em>GSM routing</em>. You should see a page similar to the one in the screenshot displayed below.</p>
<p><img src="static/OfficeRoute9_1.png" /><br />
</p>
<p>Use the pencil to the right of each row to change the service name of the <em>IVR menu</em> to that associated with your new Freedom Fone voice menu(s). When done, click the save button in the bottom right hand corner of the screen. As you will probably have figured out, it is possible to have each GSM module (SIM card) pointing to the same or a different IVR menu by changing the service name associated with the module. The <em>Description</em> field is for documentation purposes.</p>
<p><img src="static/OfficeRoute10_1.png" /></p>
<p>Having followed the steps to this point, you are ready to use your OfficeRoute with Freedom Fone.</p>
<h2><strong>3. Advanced Setup</strong></h2>
<p>The following is advanced set up and not necessary for basic use.</p>
<h3><strong>3a. Changing Admin user password</strong></h3>
<p>There are two ways of changing the default password of the OfficeRoute:</p>
<p>If you are connecting to the OfficeRoute for the first time, or connecting after a factory reset, you can use the <em>OfficeRoute wizard</em>.</p>
<p>The second way is to log into the OfficeRoute using the default username (<em>Admin</em>) and password (<em>2n</em>), then select the <em>User Management</em> tab at the top of the page to change these details.</p>
<p>The two methods are outlined below.</p>
<p>Important: Since Freedom Fone uses the password to authenticate with the OfficeRoute, you must modify a Freedom Fone configuration file to use the new password. Communication between Freedom Fone and the OfficeRoute will fail until you do so. Instructions are provided in the sub section entitled <em>Modify Freedom Fone configuration file</em>.</p>
<p><strong>i. Using the Wizard</strong></p>
<p>From the wizard’s LHS menu, select option 2, <em>Administrator's password</em>. You will be prompted to enter the new password twice and when done click on the <em>save</em> button at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p><img src="static/OfficeRoute11_1.png" /></p>
<p><strong>ii. Changing Password using <em>User Management</em> tab</strong></p>
<p>Select the <em>User Management</em> tab at the top of the page. Next select <em>Users</em> from the menu on the LHS. Use the edit function (pencil) on the row with user <em>Admin</em>. Enter the new password twice in the fields provided on the form and save.</p>
<p><img src="static/OfficeRoute12_1.png" /></p>
<p><strong>3A1. Modify Freedom Fone configuration file</strong></p>
<p>Use the command line terminal icon in Freedom Fone to go into terminal mode. (Click on the terminal icon in the centre of the title bar at the top of your screen). At the command line prompt type the following command:</p>
<p>For version 2.0 users<br />
</p>
<pre><code>gedit /usr/local/freedomfone/office_route/config.php</code></pre>
<p>For version 2.S users</p>
<pre><code>gedit /opt/freedomfone/office_route/config.php</code></pre>
<p>The <em>config.php</em> file should open in the <em>gedit</em> editor. Look for the code snippet shown below and change the 'pass' setting to the new password you have set for the OfficeRoute. Save and close the file.</p>
<p>If you are connecting more than one OfficeRoute you should change the other instances of 'pass' following the code snippet shown below.</p>
<pre><code>$_OfficerouteParamSingle = array(
 array(
  &#39;host&#39;=&gt;&#39;192.168.1.46&#39;,
  &#39;user&#39;=&gt;&#39;Admin&#39;,
  &#39;pass&#39; =&gt;&#39;2n&#39;,
  &#39;port&#39; =&gt;&#39;110&#39;
 )
);</code></pre>
<h3>3b. Changing the default IP address of the OfficeRoute</h3>
<p>The default IP address assigned to a new OfficeRoute by the supplier is <em>192.168.1.1</em>. If the Freedom Fone OfficeRoute backup config file has been uploaded to the OfficeRoute, the IP address of the device will be set to <em>192.168.1.46</em>.</p>
<p>You can modify the OfficeRoute's IP address by selecting the <em>Network</em> tab at the top of the page. Next select <em>Main configuration</em> from the menu displayed on the LHS. Select the modify icon in the bottom right hand corner of the screen to edit details on this screen.</p>
<p>Important: Since Freedom Fone uses the OfficeRoute IP address to authenticate with the OfficeRoute, you must modify 2 Freedom Fone configuration files to reference the new IP address. Communication between Freedom Fone and the OfficeRoute will fail until you do so. Instructions are provided in the sub section entitled <em>Modify Freedom Fone configuration files</em>.</p>
<p>Remember to save your changes.</p>
<p><img src="static/OfficeRoute13_5.png" /></p>
<p><strong>3B1. Modify Freedom Fone configuration files</strong></p>
<p>Use the command line terminal icon in Freedom Fone to go into terminal mode.</p>
<p>i. At the command line prompt type the following command:</p>

 )
);</code></pre>
<p>Save and close the file.</p>
<h3>3c. Changing the virtual IP address of the Freedom Fone server</h3>
<p>By default the Freedom Fone server is allocated a secondary fixed IP address of <em>192.168.1.250</em> which is assigned as a virtual IP address to <em>eth0:0</em></p>
<p>To view the server’s network settings, use the command line terminal icon in Freedom Fone to go into terminal mode. Type the following command:</p>
<pre><code>ifconfig</code></pre>
<p>Details will be displayed as shown in the screenshot below.</p>
<p><img src="static/OfficeRoute14_5.png" /></p>
<p>If you need to change the secondary fixed IP address allocated by default to the Freedom Fone server you must follow the steps below.</p>
<p>Note though, that you can modify the OfficeRoute SIP server setting to refer directly to the primary IP address of the Freedom Fone server instead of the secondary fixed IP address. If you are having problems with your setup, try taking this step (3d) before modifying the secondary fixed IP address.</p>
<p>Use the command line terminal icon in Freedom Fone to go into terminal mode.</p>
<p>i. At the command line prompt type the following command:</p>
<pre><code>gedit /etc/rc.local </code></pre>
<p>Look for the code snippet shown below and change <em>192.168.1.250</em> as required for the interface aliasing for the OfficeRoute.</p>
<pre><code>/sbin/ifconfig eth0:0 192.168.1.250 netmask 255.255.255.0 up</code></pre>
<p>Save and close the file.</p>
<p>ii. At the command line prompt type the following command:</p>

<p>Don’t forget to update the corresponding setting on the OfficeRoute by following the next step, <em>&quot;Change the SIP server setting on the OfficeRoute.&quot;</em></p>
<h3>3d. Changing the SIP server setting on the OfficeRoute</h3>
<p>If you do not want to use the default IP settings for the Freedom Fone server (a secondary fixed IP address of <em>192.168.1.250</em> which is assigned as a virtual IP address to <em>eth0:0)</em>, you can modify the default SIP server setting used by the OfficeRoute to communicate with the Freedom Fone server.</p>
<p>Select the <em>Telephony Services</em> tab at the top of the page. Next select <em>Devices</em> from the menu on the LHS and <em>SIP lines</em> from the submenu that is subsequently displayed beneath <em>Devices</em>.</p>
<p><img src="static/OfficeRoute15_5.png" /></p>
<p>Use the edit icon (pencil) to change the IP address of the SIP server from <em>192.168.1.250</em> to the primary IP address of your Freedom Fone server.</p>
<p>Save your changes.</p>

<h1>Connecting a MobiGater</h1>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/mobigator1.png" /> </p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure that the MobiGater is not connected to a power supply and is also not connected via USB to the computer. The computer that Freedom Fone has been installed on must also be switched off.</li>
<li>Insert the SIM card into the bay inside the MobiGater. <br />
<br />
<img src="static/mobigator4.png" /></li>
<li>Make a note of the MobiGater IMEI and the telephone number of the SIM that has been inserted into it.</li>
<li>Connect the MobiGater to the power supply</li>
<li>Attach the MobiGater to the computer via the USB cable.<br />
<br />
<img src="static/mobigator3.png" /><br />
</li>
<li>If all is correct, the LEDs on the MobiGater will light up as follows: the LEDs under the power and USB icons will both light up red. The LED under the mobile phone icon will flicker red roughly every four seconds, as the SIM card polls the nearest mobile network tower. <br />
<img src="static/mobigator2.png" /></li>
<li>Turn on the computer</li>
<li>If the Freedom Fone user interface is not already open, double click the Freedom Fone shortcut on the Desktop. Select <em>Dashboard &gt; GSM channels</em> <strong></strong> from the main Freedom Fone menu. The MobiGater you’ve just connected should be displayed. You may need to click the Refresh button a number of times to see this.  </li>
</ol>
<p>We have a known problem with some computer motherboards with regards to connecting multiple MobiGaters. Connecting multiple MobiGaters on some motherboards may result in concurrent voice calls interfering with each other.</p>
<p>See the Troubleshooting section if you are having difficulty connecting MobiGaters.</p>
<h2>Modifying default settings<br />
</h2>
<p>By default the MobiGater is configured to connect calls to the Voice menu with service number 4100. To direct your calls to another <em>Voice menu</em>, or to a <em>Leave-a-Message IVR (LAM IVR)</em> you will need to edit the <em>/usr/local/freedomfone/xml_curl/dialplan.xml</em> file.</p>
<p>For 2.0 users<br />
</p>
<pre><code>gedit /usr/local/freedomfone/xml_curl/dialplan.xml</code></pre>
<p>For 2.S users<br />
</p>
<pre><code>gedit /opt/freedomfone/xml_curl/dialplan.xml</code></pre>
<p>Look for this code snippet:</p>
<pre><code>      &lt;extension name=&quot;inbound_Mobigater1&quot;&gt;
          &lt;condition field=&quot;destination_number&quot; expression=&quot;^5000$&quot;&gt;
            &lt;action application=&quot;transfer&quot; data=&quot;4100 XML default&quot;/&gt;
          &lt;/condition&gt;
      &lt;/extension&gt;
      &lt;extension name=&quot;inbound_Mobigater2&quot;&gt;
          &lt;condition field=&quot;destination_number&quot; expression=&quot;^5001$&quot;&gt;
            &lt;action application=&quot;transfer&quot; data=&quot;4100 XML default&quot;/&gt;
          &lt;/condition&gt;
      &lt;/extension&gt;
      &lt;extension name=&quot;inbound_Mobigater3&quot;&gt;
          &lt;condition field=&quot;destination_number&quot; expression=&quot;^5002$&quot;&gt;
            &lt;action application=&quot;transfer&quot; data=&quot;2100 XML default&quot;/&gt;
          &lt;/condition&gt;
      &lt;/extension&gt;</code></pre>
<p>You can see that the default values are 5000-&gt;4100, 5001-&gt;4100, 5002-&gt;2100. In version 2.0, this file will be created via the GUI once we implement ACL with the system. <br />

<p><span id="ch043_testing-your-set-up.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Testing your set up</h1>
<p>After installation has been completed, and all the GSM devices have been connected, why not test Freedom Fone with the audio samples supplied? Freedom Fone comes bundled with a entire sample <em>Voice Menu</em> which allows you to test the functionality and configuration of your Freedom Fone installation.</p>
<h2>Voice Menus</h2>
<p>A sample menu called <em>Cholera</em> will be available immediately after installation. This menu has been designed to test the selection of items within the menu, and to demonstrate Freedom Fones' ability.</p>
<p>To test, simply place a call to the SIM card that has been installed in your GSM device during installation from a telephone, and listen out for the <em>Cholera</em> menu welcome tune. </p>
<p>Listen carefully to the prompts and select one of the Menu options offered. Once the Menu option completes, you will hear the Voice menu’s Instructions prompt repeat.</p>
<p>If you CANNOT get Freedom Fone to respond to the selections you are making using your phone’s key pad, see the Troubleshooting Guide in the Documentation folder on the Freedom Fone Desktop.</p>
<p>To monitor your call, select <em>System Data &gt; Call data records</em> from the main Freedom Fone menu. You can click on the Refresh button at any time to view information associated with completed calls or calls in progress.</p>
<p>You can see details of key selections made by a caller in response to a Voice menu by selecting <em>Voice menus &gt; Monitoring</em> from the main Freedom Fone menu. </p>
<h2>Leave a Message</h2>
<p>In the sample menu <em>Cholera</em>, you are able to test the <em>Leave a Message</em> functionality.</p>
<p>To test, place a call to the SIM card that has been installed in your GSM device during installation from a telephone, and listen out for the <em>Cholera</em> menu welcome tune.</p>
<p>Listen out for, and follow the menu option to <em>Leave a Message</em> (option #5). Follow the audio prompts, leave your audio recording, then hang up. </p>
<p>You will hear the default Freedom Fone <em>Leave-a-Message IVR Menu</em> and experience the basic Leave-a-Message functionality.</p>
<p>After you hear a beep, you should leave your voice message and then hang up. This action will automatically cause your voice message to be saved.</p>
<p>When you then access the <em>Message Center Inbox</em>, you should see your newly created audio file. Try playing it, and see how the quality is.</p>
<p>If you hear this, Success! Your GSM devices and Freedom Fone are now configured correctly for Leave a Message.</p>
<h2>SMS</h2>
<p>To test the SMS receiving functionality, sending a simple SMS to the number in your GSM device from another telephone will suffice. After you have sent this, visit the <em>Message Centre - Incoming SMS</em> to see if your SMS has arrived.</p>
<p>If you see this, Success! Your GSM devices and Freedom Fone are now configured correctly for SMS.</p>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>If you do not get an expected result, check out our troubleshooting guide in this book for hints on how to fix common issues surrounding configuration and installation.</p>
<p><span id="ch044_localise-user-interface.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Localise user interface</h1>
<p>Freedom Fone facilitates PO based localisation. For more technical information on how to extract all strings into a PO file, read the Localisation section of our Developers' Guide.</p>
<p>Freedom Fone have already localised the user interface into various languages that you can take advantage of. If you would like to change your version of Freedom Fone into a language more suitable for you, follow these steps. </p>
<p>The example provided is for adding a French localisation.</p>
<p>Download a copy of the latest French language file from the Freedom Fone website.</p>
<p>Copy your localised po file to the Desktop on your Freedom Fone server. If it has a different file name, rename your localised po ­file to default.po</p>
<p>Open a <strong>terminal window</strong> (by clicking on the Terminal icon in the centre of the Title bar at the top of the Freedom Fone desktop screen) and create a new folder with the three letter ISO code (ISO_639­3) for the new language. Make sure to use international conventions to name your folder. For more information visit <span><em></em></span><em><a href="http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/codes.asp">http://www.sil.org/iso639­-3/codes.asp</a></em></p>
<p>For 2.0 users<br />
</p>
<pre><code>cd /usr/local/freedomfone/gui/app/locale
sudo mkdir fre
cd fre</code></pre>
<p>For 2.S users<br />
</p>
<pre><code>cd /opt/freedomfone/gui/app/locale
sudo mkdir fre
cd fre</code></pre>
<p>Create a folder called LC_MESSAGES under your new language folder</p>
<pre><code>sudo mkdir LC_MESSAGES
cd LC_MESSAGES</code></pre>
<p>Copy your localised default.po file to the LC_MESSAGES folder</p>
<pre><code> cp /home/manguensis/Desktop/default.po default.po</code></pre>
<p>Important: Please note that the folder name 'manguensis' may change if you are using a different version:<br />
v2.0.x = sekowei<br />
v2.D.x = suyo</p>
<p>Change permissions to make default.po executable by all users</p>
<pre><code>chmod a-x default.po</code></pre>
<p>Next, we need to add the new language as an option to the dropdown language selector on the Freedom Fone <em>Dashboard &gt; Settings</em> page.</p>
<p>Open the CakePHP configuration file</p>
<p>For 2.0 users<br />
</p>
<pre><code>gedit /usr/local/freedomfone/gui/app/config/config.php </code></pre>
<p>For 2.S users<br />
</p>
<pre><code>gedit /opt/freedomfone/gui/app/config/config.php </code></pre>
<p>and add your language to the bottom of the $config['LANGUAGES'] variable. Make sure to add a comma to the end of the line above your entry.</p>
<pre><code>config[&#39;LANGUAGES&#39;]=   array(
&#39;eng&#39;   =&gt;   __(&#39;English&#39;,true),
&#39;swa&#39;   =&gt;   __(&#39;Swahili&#39;,true),
&#39;esp&#39;   =&gt;   __(&#39;Spanish&#39;,true),
&#39;fre&#39;   =&gt;   __(&#39;French&#39;,true)
);</code></pre>
<p>In the background, CakePHP applies the selected locale in the AppController (before Filter).</p>
<p>To test your localisation, go to the Freedom Fone Dashboard &gt; Settings page and select your new language option.</p>
<p><span id="ch046_installation.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Installation</h1>
<h2>Installation does not start<br />
</h2>
<p>If you notice when installing that your computer loads straight back into your previous operating system, there may be an issue with your BIOS boot order settings. </p>
<p>The instructions on how to get into the BIOS settings varies for different computer models. Please consult your computer's manual for more instructions.</p>
<p>You may also fail to see the first screen in the Installation sequence if your Freedom Fone install DVD has defaulted to LiveCD mode. This happens by default if you wait too long before selecting the <em>Install Custom Live CD</em> option.<br />
</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span id="ch047_gsm-devices.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>GSM device</h1>
<h2>Phone number not available</h2>
<p>Go to the <em>Dashboard &gt; GSM channels</em> <strong></strong> screen in the Freedom Fone user interface to check the signal level associated with the SIM card you are calling.</p>
<p>On the tables that appear, look for the <em>Signal level</em> column.<br />
</p>
<h3>For the OfficeRoute</h3>
<p>Signal level values for the OfficeRoute can be poor, good or excellent. If the signal is poor please find a better location for the OfficeRoute or extend your aerial to a place where you can get better reception.</p>
<p>Also check that the IMSI number is present for each SIM card in the OfficeRoute. If not, shut down both the computer and the OfficeRoute, ensure that the SIM cards are properly seated and power up your devices again.</p>
<h3>For the MobiGater</h3>
<p>Signal level values for the MobiGater should read 2 or higher for satisfactory performance. If the signal level value is lower than 2 please find a better location for the MobigGater device.</p>
<p>Also check to see if both the IMSI and IMEI values are populated on the MobiGater tables. If not please shutdown your computer and power down the MobiGater device. Ensure that the SIM card is properly seated and then reconnect the device and power up again.</p>
<h2>Calls continuously ring</h2>
<p>There are many causes for this problem and we have outlined them in the logical order in which you should troubleshoot.</p>
<p>a) An expired License or a not fully licensed OfficeRoute causes calls not to be transferred to the Freedom Fone. To check that you have a full License enter the IP address of the OfficeRoute in a browser and log in. Under the network tab check to see that SNMP is enabled as well as that the License has not expired. If you find that your license has expired or that you don't have all features enabled please contact your supplier of the OfficeRoute.</p>
<p>b) eth0:0 which is the network alias has to be set on the computer running Freedom Fone in order for Freedom Fone to communicate with the OfficeRoute. If you issue an <em>ifconfig</em> command (click on the Terminal icon in the centre of the title bar at the top of the Freedom Fone desktop screen) and you do not see a reference to eth0:0 with an IP address of 192.168.1.250 on the output, follow the instructions on setting the network alias given in this document.<br />
</p>
<p>c) If FreeSWITCH has stopped running Freedom Fone will not communicate with the OfficeRoute. From Freedom Fone navigate to: <em>Dashboard → Health</em>, on the interface that appears, check to see if both the Freeswitch and the dispatcher are running. If both are running a green tick will show against each, if not a red circle will show.</p>
<p>If the FreeSWITCH has stopped for some reason, open the command terminal and issue the following command:</p>
<pre><code>service freeswitch restart</code></pre>
<p>The following message should appear after running that command;</p>
<pre><code> Freedom Fone: Starting Freeswitch freeswitch</code></pre>
<p>If the dispatcher has stopped, run the following command from the command terminal;</p>
<pre><code>/etc/init.d/dispatcher_in reload</code></pre>
<p>This command should be followed by an output shown below</p>
<pre><code> Freedom Fone: Stopping dispatcher [OK]
 Freedom Fone: Starting dispatcher [OK]</code></pre>
<p>After issuing the above commands navigate to <em>Dashboard &gt; GSM channels</em>, refresh the page and check if the MobiGaters / OfficeRoute have registered to your local current time. NB: It may take several refreshes before the GSM devices register.</p>
<p>When done, try calling the numbers inside your GSM devices.</p>
<p>If the SIP server IP address is not set to the IP address of the computer running Freedom Fone, calls to the OfficeRoute will ring continuously. To rectify this open the OfficeRoute interface by typing the IP address of the OfficeRoute into the browser URL window.</p>
<p>An OfficeRoute interface should appear, login with the correct username and password. The default username: Admin and the password; 2n.</p>
<p>From the office route interface click on the “Telephony services” tab at the top of the page.</p>
<p>On the interface which appears , look to your left and navigate to <em>Devices &gt; SIP lines</em></p>
<p>Use the edit function to edit the IP address of the SIP server. This address should be the same as for the computer running Freedom Fone.</p>
<h2>Calls immediately cut off after one ring</h2>
<p>This can be caused by a call that is routed to an IVR menu that does not exist. It may be due to an IVR being accidentally deleted during operations.<br />
From Freedom Fone navigate to ; <em>IVR Centre &gt; Voice Menu</em>. On the interface that appears ensure that there is at least one IVR menu set. If none is set, create one using the create button.</p>
<h3>For the MobiGaters</h3>
<p>If there is at least one IVR menu set on the interface and yet calls keep cutting off, please follow the instructions below:</p>
<p>Open the command terminal and enter the following command:</p>
<p>For version 2.0 users<br />
</p>
<pre><code>gedit /usr/local/freedomfone/xml_curl/dialplan.xml</code></pre>
<p>For version 2.S users</p>
<pre><code>gedit /opt/freedomfone/xml_curl/dialplan.xml</code></pre>
<p>This should launch the gedit editor with the contents of the <em>dialplan.xml</em> file displayed. Scroll down the file to a section with a subtitle “Inbound MobiGaters”. The section should look like the code snippet shown below</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- INBOUND MOBIGATERS --&gt;
&lt;extension name=&quot;inbound_Mobigater1&quot;&gt;
 &lt;condition field=&quot;destination_number&quot; expression=&quot;^5000$&quot;&gt;
  &lt;action application=&quot;transfer&quot; data=&quot;4100 XML default&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;/condition&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;
&lt;extension name=&quot;inbound_Mobigater2&quot;&gt;
 &lt;condition field=&quot;destination_number&quot; expression=&quot;^5001$&quot;&gt;
  &lt;action application=&quot;transfer&quot; data=&quot;4100 XML default&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;/condition&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;
&lt;extension name=&quot;inbound_Mobigater3&quot;&gt;
 &lt;condition field=&quot;destination_number&quot; expression=&quot;^5002$&quot;&gt;
  &lt;action application=&quot;transfer&quot; data=&quot;2100 XML default&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;/condition&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The IVR service numbers that are highlighted above should correspond with the IVR service numbers that exist on your Freedom Fone server. Make sure that the service numbers shown in your <em>dialplan.xml</em> file exist on your Freedom Fone. If the dialplan is directing calls to a voice menu that does not exist simply edit the service number to a valid IVR service number. If you want to direct a specific MobiGater to a Voice Menu other than the default 4100/ 2100 you can simply change the service number to the desired service number of the voice menu you have created.</p>
<h3>For the OfficeRoute</h3>
<p>If you check the Voice Menus page of the Freedom Fone and see that there is at least one IVR Menu set please follow the instructions below:</p>
<p>Open the OfficeRoute web interface by typing the IP address of the OfficeRoute into the browser URL window. Login by entering the username and password. The default settings are:</p>
<p><strong>username</strong> : <em>Admin</em><br />
<strong>Password</strong> : <em>2n</em></p>
<p>After successfully logging in, click on the “Telephony services” tab at the top of the page . On the page that appears look to your right and click on the <em>GSM routing</em> link, under the link click on <em>GSM</em>.</p>
<p>On the interface which appears ensure that each GSM module is directed to an IVR service number that exists on the Freedom Fone. You can use the edit function to the right of each row to specify the service number of the IVR.</p>
<h2>Calls going through but audio being played by laptop speakers</h2>
<p>Some laptops may experience a problem in routing the audio back to the caller after answering a call. The audio is then routed to the speakers of the laptop instead of back to the caller via the phone. The caller will experience silence on her phone although the phone will show that a call is in progress. This is an issue to do with the USB of the laptop and is usually experienced when running two MobiGaters on adjacent USB ports. To rectify this follow the instructions below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Shutdown laptop and power off MobiGater</li>
<li>Remove one of the adjacent MobiGaters and plug it in another USB which does not have anything connected adjacent to it.</li>
<li>Reboot your Laptop and start MobiGater.</li>
</ol>
<h2>OfficeRoute does not display on GSM channel page although inbound calls being answered</h2>
<p>This is usually the case when you change the default IP address of the OfficeRoute <em>192.168.1.46</em> to something else. Freedom Fone uses the IP address of the OfficeRoute to capture setting information such as IMSI number, Network registration,Operator and Signal level.<br />
</p>
<p>To rectify this open and edit the <em>config.php</em> file <em></em>using the following command:</p>
<p>For version 2.0 users<br />
</p>
<pre><code>gedit /usr/local/freedomfone/gui/app/config/config.php</code></pre>
<p>For version 2.S users</p>
<pre><code>gedit /opt/freedomfone/gui/app/config/config.php</code></pre>
<p> Change the IP address of the OfficeRoute in the <em>config.php</em> file to the new IP address that you have assigned the OfficeRoute. The section you edit should look like the code snippet shown below;</p>
<pre><code>config[&#39;OR_SNMP&#39;]= array(
  array(&#39;ip_addr&#39; =&gt; &#39;192.168.1.46&#39; ,
      &#39;community&#39; =&gt; &#39;public&#39; ,
      &#39;object_id&#39; =&gt; &#39;1.3.6.1.4.1.6530.4.2.2.1&#39;
      ));</code></pre>
<p>When done save the file and refresh your GSM channels page on Freedom Fone, you should see the registered OfficeRoute.</p>
<p><span id="ch048_problems-with-voice-menus.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Problems with Voice menus</h1>
<h2>I can’t hear the voice menu prompts because a voice keeps nagging me about Cepstral.</h2>
<p>Cepstral is the text to speech (TTS) software used in Freedom Fone.  Our software will work without a licence but before it reads each line of text, Cepstral will play a reminder that you need to buy a licence. We are using the Allison 8 Khz voice for Linux.</p>
<p>You will be hearing this voice because you have entered text in the large text box labeled <em>Description</em> in your Voice menu. If this is not what you want, you can remove this text and it will stop this problem.</p>
<h3>Fix 1:Buy and register a licence for Allison 8 Khz from the Cepstral website</h3>
<p>A licence for the Allison 8 Khz voice for Linux can be bought from https://www.cepstral.com/. Once you get the licence you can register the voice by running the swift executable from the command prompt as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a terminal window by clicking the terminal icon in the centre of the title bar at the top of your screen.</li>
<li>If you are prompted to do so, enter the password lupinus.</li>
<li>At the prompt type</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>/opt/swift/bin/swift --reg-voice</code></pre>
<p>Follow the instructions to enter the details associated with your licence. You will be asked for Name, Organisation and Licence key</p>
<h3>Fix 2: Create your own audio files and avoid text to speech completely</h3>
<p>If you use your own audio files you do not need to use text to speech at all!</p>
<h2>I have tried to upload Menu options but none of my files are reflected on the Menu options screen. What’s going wrong?</h2>
<p>The chances are that the file you tried to upload was larger than the maximum file size of 10MB allowed. Downsize the audio file by shortening its duration and/or ensuring it has been created as a WAV or MP3 file that is mono with a sampling rate of 8Khz.</p>
<p>Characters other than a-z, 0-9 or - and _ can create problems in filenames when you upload the files. If you see the <em>File not found</em> message when you try to play uploaded audio content, try re-uploading the content with a filename that follows the about rules.</p>
<p><span id="ch049_networking.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Networking</h1>
<h2>Network card is not recognised after hibernation<br />
</h2>
<p>This is a bug on Ubuntu, your interface names such as <em>eth0</em> are assigned to a physical interface, specifically the MAC address of that interface. When you hibernate and then try to restart, the system tries to assign a new MAC address to your NIC. So when your MAC address changes the system thinks it’s a new network card and assigns the next free name, lets say eth1.</p>
<p>However your network configuration file is still referring to the old name <em>eth0</em>. So basically you end up trying to apply configuration to a NIC that doesn’t exist, while there is a new NIC with no configuration. Basically no more network…</p>
<p>So how do you fix it?</p>
<p>Make a backup of the <em>70-persistent-net.rules</em> file:</p>
<pre><code>sudo cp /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-backup </code></pre>
<p>Now when you have done a backup remove the file</p>
<pre><code>sudo rm /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules </code></pre>
<p>Reboot the machine</p>
<pre><code>reboot </code></pre>
<p>So basically that just deleted all of the old MAC address to name (eth0) mappings, so when the system boots these should be correctly created again.</p>
<h2>Network card is not recognised on new installation<br />
</h2>
<p>Not all Network cards have drivers which are supported by Ubuntu. It may happen that after installing your Freedom Fone on a computer, you find that the Ethernet card does not appear when you issue the <em>ifconfig</em> command. The solution to this can be to change the Ethernet card. When choosing a network card to replace, try and get something that is not the latest, as usually Ubuntu takes time to update its driver database.</p>
<p>If you don't have another network card, you can connect a USB GSM modem to the computer or laptop and connect to the Internet and then follow the instructions below. If you don't have the USB modem, you will have to do this on another computer with Internet connectivity and then transfer the files you would have downloaded.</p>
<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
<p>To download, compile and install the driver, first go to http://linuxwireless.org/download/compat-wireless-2.6 and download the file named <em>compat-wireless-2.6.tar.bz2</em> (you can't download it in the terminal because of anti-hotlinking). Save it to your desktop. Then run these commands in a command terminal:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential
cd ~/Desktop
tar -xjvf compat-wireless-2.6.tar.bz2
cd compat-wireless-2.6.39-1/drivers/net/atl1c
make
sudo make install </code></pre>
<p>Then reboot. Hopefully your Ethernet will work automatically after reboot; if not, run:</p>
<pre><code>sudo modprobe atl1c</code></pre>
<p>to insert the driver.</p>
<p>NB: Although the drivers are included in the compat-wireless stack they are actually drivers for an ethernet card not the wireless card. In the example I chose the <em>compat-wireless-2.6.39-1.tar.bz2</em> because it is the latest stable release for the kernel I am using. Whenever you look for drivers in future, choose the latest stable release for the kernel you are running on. To check the kernel version issue the command <em>uname -r</em> on the command terminal.</p>
<h2>Setting network alias permanently<br />
</h2>
<p>Freedom Fone sets the network alias on <em>eth0:0</em> at boot time via the <em>/etc/rc.local</em> script. This setting is not permanent and is set each time you boot up. If for some reason the networking is not enabled when you boot up the alias cannot be set. This presents a challenge since Freedom Fone uses this alias to communicate with the OfficeRoute. In such a scenario, in order to get Freedom Fone working you will have to enable networking and reboot the machine.</p>
<p>To avert having to reboot the machine every time you forget to enable networking before rebooting, make the following additions to the <em>/etc/network/interfaces</em> file (click on the Terminal icon in the centre of the Title bar on your Freedom Fone desktop).</p>
<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
<pre><code>sudo gedit /etc/network/interfaces</code></pre>
<p>Append the following configuration:</p>
<pre><code>auto eth0:0
iface eth0:0 inet static
name Ethernet alias LAN card
address 192.168.1.250
netmask 255.255.255.0
broadcast 192.168.1.255
network 192.168.1.0</code></pre>
<p>Save the file and restart the network with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart </code></pre>
<p>From now on, if the eth0:0 does not appear after boot because networking has been disabled, you will simply enable networking by right clicking on the wireless network icon at the top task bar, and then issue the command above for restarting the network.</p>

<h1>Other problems</h1>
<h2>Problems with times</h2>
<p>If you find that the log files are reporting the times incorrect or that the start time of <em>Polls</em> is not adhering, then there may be an issue with your system time.</p>
<p>Check to see if the time in the top right corner of your Freedom Fone installation computer is set correctly. If it is not, you may click on it and set it.   </p>
<h2>Freedom Fone interface freezes</h2>
<p>This is usually caused by pulling out the GSM devices whilst Freedom Fone is running. Please check that the power to the GSM devices is stable and all connections to the computer are firm.</p>

<h1>FAQs</h1>
<p>This chapter aims to address frequently asked questions relating to Freedom Fone.</p>
<h2>Can I use the Freedom Fone computer for other things?</h2>
<p>It is recommended that the Freedom Fone computer is only used for Freedom Fone. This is because Freedom Fone is resource intensive, and so if other applications are sharing the system resources, this may interfere with the calls.</p>
<h2>Where can I get technical support?</h2>
<p>Please see our &quot;Support&quot; chapter for information on how to get answers to your questions.</p>
<h2>Why does the menu option selection not appear to work? </h2>
<p>Some mobile carriers do not send the DTMF (the tone when a key is pressed) correctly, and Freedom Fone is unable to determine what selection the caller has made. </p>

<h1>Introduction to Mobile Phone Security</h1>
<p>Most people have mobile phones today. In the past these devices were primarily used to call and send text messages. In addition, all mobiles have at least an ability to keep an address book. There is a new generation of mobile devices that come with Internet access, built-in video cameras and the ability to install additional software. These smart phones can be very convenient and provide you with very powerful and useful tools. These phones contain a lot of private data and, unfortunately, a phone can be lost easily. The following chapter deals with some methods to use them more secure.</p>
<h2>Security issues with mobile phones</h2>
<p><strong>Physical security</strong> - A phone can be confiscated or stolen. If you are a journalist, your address book might be of special interest: it can be used just to gain knowledge of your network or for further social engineering. As a minimum safety measure you should always enable some kind of password protection on your phone (not just on your SIM card).</p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong> - Although the voice on a GSM (mobile phone) channel is encrypted, this encryption was hacked some time ago and is not considered safe any more. Furthermore, if you do not trust the network(s) you are using it has never been safe. Normal VoIP communications are very insecure as they are not encrypted. Some other VoIP services use some kind of encryption.</p>
<p><strong>SMS</strong> - Text messages are sent in plain text over the network, so they are also not considered secure, additionally they are not securely stored at your device, so anyone with access to it will be able to read them. If you are using an Android based phone read the chapter on 'Secure Text Messaging'</p>
<p><strong>Smartphones</strong> - Smartphones are quite new, and unfortunately most advanced (and even some basic) ways of securing that are available on normal computers are not available on smartphones. They pose additional risk since you are also using them for things like agendas, and personal note taking. Also not all applications in an appstore or market are safe to use, because there are a considerable number of <em>malware</em> apps on the market which are passing your personal data to other companies. You should always check if the app's you want to use can be trusted. Internet on your mobile device is subject to the same problems as all wireless communications. Read the chapter on VPN for mobile devices to improve this. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Prepaid sim cards</strong> - In some countries you are still able to use prepaid locally bought SIMcards without identifying yourself. Beware that your phone also has a unique identifier (known as the IMEI number) so switching SIM cards will will not guarantee to protect your privacy.</p>
<p>The following chapters will deal with different methods that are available today to secure your mobile communications. Note that mobile phone security in particular is developing very fast and users should check out the current status of premier open source efforts like the Guardian Project (<a href="https://guardianproject.info/">guardianproject.info</a>).</p>
<p><span id="ch056_about-free-software.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Free Software?</h1>
<p>Freedom Fone is <strong>Free Software</strong> - this means it is developed by a community and licensed in a generous way so you can use it for free for whatever you want.</p>
<p>Free Software (sometimes also referred to as <strong>Free and Open Source Software</strong>, <strong>FLOSS</strong>, <strong>FOSS</strong>, <strong>Software Libre</strong>, or <strong>Open Source</strong>) is software that anyone can download, share, and -- significantly -- change in any way they want. Practically speaking, you might never want to change the software, or even have a staff person who can read the <strong>source code</strong> (the instructions written by programmers). But the ability to change the software protects you in many ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Freedom Fone</strong> will not go away, unlike non-free software from some companies that gets abandoned if the company goes bankrupt or decides to discontinue specific product.</li>
<li>The software can be used and customised free of charge.</li>
<li>Nobody can suddenly take away features or change the terms under which you're allowed to use features.</li>
<li>If an organisation wants a feature that Freedom Fone doesn't provide, the organisation can just hire someone to create it. Of course, the organisation can also submit a feature request to the Freedom Fone team as with any software product.</li>
<li>Similarly, anyone can fix a <strong>bug</strong> (error in the software) if he or she has the skills to do so. Because the source code is available, clients can also find bugs more easily.</li>
<li>Members of the community have much more input into how Freedom Fone develops, because they can understand the product by reading the code and can make changes. Furthermore, many people can try different implementations of features and the community can decide by vote or consensus which one to make official.</li>
</ul>
<p>That may be enough for you, but for the sake of completeness we'll offer some widely used definitions:</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Free software</strong> or <strong>software libre</strong> is software that can be used, studied, and modified without restriction, and which can be copied and redistributed in modified or unmodified form either without restriction, or with minimal restrictions only to ensure that further recipients can also do these things and that manufacturers of consumer-facing hardware allow user modifications to their hardware. Free software is available gratis (free of charge) in most cases.&quot;<em><br />
(from: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software" class="uri">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software</a>)</em></p>
<p><strong>&quot;Open source software (OSS)</strong> is defined as computer software for which the source code and certain other rights normally reserved for copyright holders are provided under a software license that meets the Open Source Definition or that is in the public domain. This permits users to use, change, and improve the software, and to redistribute it in modified or unmodified forms. It is very often developed in a public, collaborative manner.&quot;<br />
<em>(from: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_software" class="uri">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_software</a>)</em></p>
<p>Nearly any software that qualifies as free also qualifies as Open Source, and vice versa. The main reason that two different terms exist is that &quot;free software&quot; emphasizes the freedom aspect (that you aren't under the control of the original programmers) whereas &quot;open source software&quot; emphasizes the convenience and potential for innovation provided by having the source code available.</p>
<p>When you install and use Freedom Fone, you'll notice there's no annoying click-through <strong>software license</strong> imposing a thousand things that you can or cannot do with it. That's because free software doesn't limit your right to do with the software whatever you want. Free and open source software have licenses, but they're simpler than and quite different from <strong>proprietary</strong> <strong>software</strong> ('closed software') licenses. Freedom Fone itself is available under the <strong>Mozilla Public License Version 1.1</strong>, one of the popular free software licenses used by many other projects.</p>
<h2>Free Software and non-profits</h2>
<p>Explaining all of the possible considerations on using FOSS in non-profit and advocacy work might take a really long time, so let's focus on the most important highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the priorities of FOSS projects, including Freedom Fone, is to involve the community of users in the process of designing and building the software. In the long run, this not only assures that the software is doing exactly what it should do to sustain the needs of its users, but it also allows indirect exchange of knowledge and experience between organisations. By using Freedom Fone, you're basically taking advantage of other non-profit and advocacy practitioners' experience.</li>
<li>Having access to the source code gives you and your organisation certain independence. With proprietary software it's usually impossible to customise the tools to meet your specific needs. With FOSS, you can hire a developer or consultant and work with them on providing specific functionality needed in your work. Additionally, if you contribute your improvements to the project community other organisations will most probably start using them. It means you can receive testing and further improvements of your functionality.</li>
<li>When a company which provided you with a closed software goes out of business, the usual procedure for an organisation reliant on that software is to abandon the software and start investing in a new one (which is resource intensive and costly). It's less likely to happen with Free and Open Source Software - there is always a community of users and developers around it and there is no single &quot;point of failure&quot;. With FOSS projects, if the main organisation behind a specific piece of software shuts down or changes their focus, the community takes over, a new organisation is formed and the software development and support continues.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from the quite practical advantages listed above, there is also a more philosophical approach to answering the question of importance of FOSS for non-profits and advocacy organisations. Without getting too deep into philosophical discussions, there is a great overlap between values shared by non-profit organisations and these shared by Free and Open Source Software communities. By working with the community of users, providing your feedback, contributing your changes back into the project, you're actually strengthening the non-profit sector.</p>

<h1>About this book</h1>
<p>This guide was authored together in November 2011, over a six day period in Nyanga Zimbabwe, by a team of 11 people drawn from 6 countries.</p>
<p>Kubatana brought us together, mined the contents of our heads, the experiences of literally thousands of others who are part of the Freedom Fone story and the support of donors and well wishers who have believed in the Freedom Fone ethos.</p>
<p>For many of us who have been used to the processes of creation taking months and sometimes years the tool and process we used called Booksprint was a revelation. Individual thought and writing, two person teams, pow wows of the whole team fueled by respectful argument, disagreement, eventual compromise and recommitment to the task of finishing the guide to deadline all led to a roller coaster ride that was exhilarating and satisfying.</p>
<p>Seven hundred hours of our collective effort has produced around thirty thousand words of description and many illustrations that we hope is a coherent whole and a useful tool to help you use this fantastic software called Freedom Fone.</p>
<p>The story is never complete and your contribution can help us to improve this manual and 'keep it live'. By using Freedom Fone, testing this guide out and letting us know how relevant it is - you too will become an author of something that really does help many others!</p>
<p>You will join that community of Free and Open Software developers and users that are changing paradigms of ownership and control of information and tools. We welcome you and your contribution and wish you well in your journey with Freedom Fone!</p>
<p>The spirit of Ruparara be with you!<br />
