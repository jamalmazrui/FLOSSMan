<h1>Welcome to Mifos</h1>
<p><em>Important</em>: Before reading this document, you must read the <a href="http://mifos.org/documentation/configuration" title="Mifos Configuration Guide">configuration guide</a> and configure your Mifos (Microfinance Open Source) system. Many of the choices you make within Mifos depend on your configuration decisions, and some options may not appear or may be unavailable to you, based on the configuration.</p>
<p>Mifos is a management information system (MIS) that can be accessed over a network using a web browser. It is designed to give microfinance institutions (MFIs) a way to create and maintain their structure, get information quickly about their operations and their clients, and grow easily. We assume that users of this manual are familiar with the purpose of microfinance (starting with helping people out of poverty by basing loans on ability to repay, not just collateral) and the practices of at least one MFI, such as loans to groups, client training in business and banking, and specific loan and savings account types.</p>
<p>This user manual applies to the current release, Mifos 1.5.  It's an update of our <a href="http://db.tt/BXRHwfD" title="1.0 User Manual .doc download">previous user manual (.doc)</a> covering 1.0 functionality  To see new features and functionality covered by the scope of this new manual please see our <a href="http://mifos.org/product/download-mifos" title="List of New Features since 1.0">features added since 1.0</a> on our download page.<br />
</p>
<p>With Mifos, you can do the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set up microfinance institution (MFI) operations from scratch</li>
<li>Maintain an MFI someone else created</li>
<li>Change settings for your MFI</li>
<li>Create and maintain a hierarchy of regions, branches, and centers within your MFI</li>
<li>Create roles and assign permissions required by users at your MFI to work on Mifos</li>
<li>Create users (such as loan officers) who can work with your MFI</li>
<li>Create groups and register clients who will receive MFI services</li>
<li>Create (and change) loan products</li>
<li>Create (and change) savings products</li>
<li>Create and maintain loan accounts</li>
<li>Pay out (disburse) loans</li>

<br />
</p>
<h2><span id="ch006_how-to-navigate-within-mifos.xhtml#left-nav-panel">Left navigation panel</span></h2>
<p><br />
On the left, links marked &quot;Quick Start&quot; will take you to commonly used operations.</p>
<p>When you are in different sections of Mifos, the left navigation panel does different things:</p>
<ul>
<li>While viewing the Admin tab, you can use this panel to search for clients and accounts.</li>
<li>While viewing the Clients &amp; Accounts tab, you can use this panel to begin common operations.</li>
<li>The left navigation panel is not used while viewing the Reports tab.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="ch006_how-to-navigate-within-mifos.xhtml#opening-screen">Opening screen</span></h2>
<p>When you first login to Mifos, you see a screen that looks much like this:</p>
<p><img src="static/home.png" /><br />
</p>
<h2><span id="ch006_how-to-navigate-within-mifos.xhtml#searching">Searching</span></h2>
<p>Any time you see a Search box, as in the illustration above, you can go directly to a client, centre, group, or savings/loan account. Type the centre/group/client name, the system ID (for a client, group, or center), client's government ID, or loan/savings account number, and click <strong>Search</strong>. If there are more than one possible responses, a list appears, which might look like the following;</p>
<p> <img src="/mifos-user-manual/http:/en.flossmanuals.net/floss/pub/Mifos" width="0" height="0" /><img src="static/Mifos-mifosmultiplesearchresult-en.png" title="mifosmultiplesearchresult" alt="mifosmultiplesearchresult" width="477" height="363" /></p>

<h2><span id="ch006_how-to-navigate-within-mifos.xhtml#procedure-steps">Procedure steps</span></h2>
<p>Some procedures (like creating a loan account) have several steps. In those situations, a bar across the screen tells you which step you are in. It might look like this:</p>
<p> <img src="/mifos-user-manual/http:/en.flossmanuals.net/floss/pub/Mifos" width="0" height="0" /><img src="static/Mifos-mifosprocedurebar-en.png" title="mifosprocedurebar" alt="mifosprocedurebar" width="642" height="55" /></p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h2><span id="ch006_how-to-navigate-within-mifos.xhtml#how-to-go-back">How to go back to a previous page</span></h2>
<p>You can always press your browser's Back button to retrace your steps within Mifos.</p>
<p>You can also see the path you have taken near the top of the screen, just underneath the tabs. (This path is sometimes called a &quot;breadcrumb trail.&quot;)</p>
<p>Click anywhere on this path to return to that section.</p>
<h2><span id="ch006_how-to-navigate-within-mifos.xhtml#editable-noneditable-fields">Editable and noneditable fields</span></h2>
<p>Depending on the choices you made during configuration, and on your role within Mifos, you may not be able to edit some fields. If you try to type something in these fields, you see an error message like this:</p>
<p><img src="static/Mifos-insufficient_permission-en.png" title="insufficient_permission" alt="insufficient_permission" width="478" height="56" /><br />
</p>
<p>In addition, some fields may appear gray or dim; this is another sign that you may not change those fields.</p>
</div>
<p><span id="ch007_data-entry.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>Data entry</h1>
<p>All data entry screens in the system behave in the same way. Note the following:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>You can type data into a text field.  A text field requires typing or scanning, as in the amount and interest rate fields in the above page. </li>
<li>In a “pull-down list” or “drop-down list,” there is a predefined list of values; the user must choose one from this list. In some cases the items on this list are based on user entries; in other cases, they are configured by the MFI. For information on how to change some of these values, see <a href="http://en.flossmanuals.net/Mifos/HowToSetRulesForDataDisplay#define-change-lookup-options">How To Define And Change Lookup Options</a></li>
<li>In some cases, when the data is selected, values that depend on it are displayed automatically and cannot be changed.</li>
<li>Fields that require no data entry are dimmed.</li>
<li>Mandatory fields have a red asterisk (*) before the field name. The user must enter data in this field before the form can be completed.</li>
<li>Where the form is longer than the screen, use the scroll bar to display more fields.</li>
<li>Use the keyboard to move from one field to another; after you have entered data in a field, press Tab to move to the next field.</li>
<li>The data entry pages indicate the numbers of steps to be completed. The above section of the create loan account screen, at the top, shows that the current step is the Loan Account Information. You can click the previous step to go back to it.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span id="ch009_how-to-set-up-mfi-operations-overview.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>How to set up MFI operations: Overview</h1>
<p>If you are setting up the operations for a microfinance institution (MFI) for the first time, you need to make decisions about its structure, its rules, its user members, and their roles. Some of these decisions must be made immediately, and some will be needed only when the MFI becomes more complex. Other decisions are completely optional.<br />
</p>
<p>In the process of configuring Mifos (see the <a href="http://mifos.org/documentation/configuration" title="Mifos Configuration Guide">Configuration guide</a>), you or your administrator made many other decisions, such as the language in which Mifos is displayed to you. If you are looking for ways to control Mifos behavior and do not see them shown here, check the configuration file again.<br />
We recommend that you make the decisions in this order, if they apply to your situation:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Create any additional fields that you will need to create offices</li>
<li>Create and/or view an existing MFI structure, including all offices</li>
<li>Create roles and permissions for system users</li>
<li>Create system users</li>
<li>Create rules for data display (labels, lookup options, additional fields)</li>
<li>Define accepted payment types</li>
<li>Create fees</li>
<li>Create fund types</li>
<li>Set product categories</li>
<li>Create checklists (optional)</li>
<li>Create holidays</li>
<li>Define products (loans and savings accounts)</li>
</ol>
<p><span id="ch010_how-to-switch-between-languages.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>How to switch between languages</h1>
<p>Mifos is translated into many different languages and it gives you possibility to easily switch between them.<br />
<br />
You can choose your preferred language in two ways:<br />
1. Change language in '<strong>Your Settings</strong>' section<br />
2. Use '<strong>Change Preferred Language</strong>' link<br />
<br />
How to change language in 'Your Settings' section<br />
<br />
1. Click on <strong>Your settings</strong> link on the main screen.</p>
<p><img src="static/your%20settings.png" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>2. You may see a screen like this:</p>
<p><img src="static/your%20settings%202.png" /> </p>
<p>3. Click on <strong>Edit information</strong> <span>link. You may see:</span></p>
<p> <img src="static/edit%20settings.png" /></p>
<p> 4. Choose your preferred language from drop-down list.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="static/languages.png" /> </p>
<p>5. Click  <strong>Preview</strong> to check your entries.<br />
6. If you like to change anything, click <strong>Edit information</strong> to return to the earlier screen.<br />
7. When the entries are correct, click <strong>Submit</strong> to save them or if you decide not to change any label at this time, click <strong>Cancel</strong>.<br />
<br />
</p>
<h2>How to change language by 'Change Preferred Language' link</h2>
<p><br />
1. Click on <strong>Change Preferred Language</strong>  on the right corner on Mifos website.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="static/link.png" /> </p>
<p>2. You might see a screen like this:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="static/list.png" /></p>
<p>3. Choose your preferred language from drop-down list and click Change.<br />
<br />
</p>
<h2>How to add new language to Mifos</h2>
<p><br />
Mifos is currently fully translated into many different languages, other translations are in progress.<br />
Full stats of all languages can be viewed at<a href="http://translatewiki.net/wiki/Translating:Mifos/stats" class="uri">http://translatewiki.net/wiki/Translating:Mifos/stats</a>.<br />
<br />
New languages can be translated by using the online translation tool at <a href="http://translatewiki.net/wiki/Main_Page">Translatewiki.net</a> or by   downloading the translation message files and translating them offline in a tool like .poedit.<br />
<br />
To add a new local to Mifos you need to have some development skills to write the code. If you don't have such abilities, you need to request that new language/locale should be added into Mifos.<br />
<br />
To do that, send an email to the <a href="how-to-switch-between-languages/%20mifos-developer@lists.sourceforge.net">mifos-developer list</a> with the subject line, &quot;Please add [LOCALE] into Mifos Database.&quot; and then new locale will be added to the new version of Mifos.<br />
<br />

<p><span id="ch011_how-to-create-and-view-the-office-structure.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>How to set office structure<br />
</h1>
<p>Your MFI can have as many as five levels of offices, which can be organized according to geographical or functional divisions. All users and clients of the MFI must be attached to offices.</p>
<ul>
<li>Head office<br />
</li>
<li>Regional office<br />
</li>
<li>Divisional office</li>
<li>Area office<br />
</li>
<li>Branch office<br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>The head office is the main or parent office for an MFI. Mifos automatically creates it, and there can be only one in an MFI. During initial configuration (see the <a href="http://mifos.org/documentation/configuration">Configuration guide</a>), you must decide on specifications for at least one branch office; this is the level at which all client interactions take place. You can also decide on specifications for the other three types of offices, which are optional.</p>
<p>The following screenshot shows how to choose which levels of offices you want in Mifos.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="static/officeH.jpeg" /> <br />
</p>
<p>Once you have decided how many levels of office to have and have configured them, you can add more instances of each of them, if you have the appropriate permissions.<br />
<br />
Once you have defined an office as a head office or branch office, you cannot change it to a different office type, such as regional office, sub regional office, or area office. However, you can change the offices of these three optional types to any other level except for the head office level.</p>
<p>TIP:  If you work in an area office or a head office and also want to offer services directly to clients, you must create a &quot;virtual branch office&quot; and assign clients to it.</p>
<p>To view and update the existing office hierarchy, click <strong>Admin</strong> &gt; <strong>View Office Hierarchy</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>

</ul>
<p>Before you create the system users (such as loan officers) who will deal directly with clients, you must decide what their roles are and what permissions they will have. You must have appropriate permissions to create roles.<br />
<br />
Before beginning, note the following terms:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Activity: any system action that a user might perform, such as creating a new system user</li>
<li>Permission: authorization to execute an activity</li>
<li>Role: a named set of permissions for a particular user</li>
<li>Data scope: a set of permissions for a role, determined by the user’s place in the personnel hierarchy and in the office hierarchy  </li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="ch013_how-to-work-with-roles-permissions-and-system-users.xhtml#hierarchies">Personnel hierarchies and office hierarchies</span></h2>
<p>The personnel hierarchy has two levels:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>The Loan Officer has a data scope that is limited to his/her clients, which only she or he is able to modify as appropriate.  The Loan Officer is able to view clients assigned to other Loan Officers but cannot modify the information for them.  A Loan Officer can be attached to only one branch.  If necessary, you can create the same Loan Officer in a different branch as the same user, but in the different branch this officer must have a different system ID.</li>
<li>The Other level hierarchy has no restrictions and has unrestricted access subject to the office hierarchy explained below.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following table illustrates how these two hierarchies are related.</p>

In the list that appears, click the link for the correct one. In the details page that appears, in the <strong>Account Information</strong> and <strong>Center/Group/Client charges</strong> section, click <strong>View Details</strong> and then <strong>Apply Charges</strong>.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>If the fees are for a specific loan account, in any <strong>Search</strong> box, type the ID for the account and click <strong>Search</strong>, or navigate to that account from the center/client/group details page. Click the link that appears for that loan. In the details page that appears, in the <strong>Transactions</strong> box in the upper right corner, click <strong>Apply Charges</strong>.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>Click <strong>Apply Charges</strong>. A screen like the following appears:<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>In the <strong>Select Charge Type</strong> list, click the appropriate charge. If there is a set amount for this charge, it appears in the Amount box.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Amount</strong> box, type the amount to apply.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Submit</strong>.<br />
</li>
</ol>
<p>The charge now appears in the <strong>Upcoming Charges</strong> and the <strong>Recent Account Activity</strong> list. It will appear in <strong>Transaction History</strong> when posted. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Early Repayment of Fees</h2>
<p>This feature provides MFIs the ability to collect fees in advance of the repayment date. However, early repayment of fees is applicable only at the client, group and center level. It cannot be applied to loan accounts. </p>
<p>This feature, part of Mifos 2.1, enables fees to be assessed and collected up-front at the time in which they've been assessed. Specifically, this feature could be used by MFIs to charge a fee for withdrawal from a savings account. Currently, Mifos does not provide any option to assign penalties or fees to a savings account. If your MFI has a business need to charge fee for withdrawal from a savings account, the early fee repayment feature can be used to assign and charge that fee at the client level (as described in the section below).</p>
<p>When an early payment is made, it is paid off in the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overdue charges</li>
<li>One-time fee</li>
<li>Recurring fee</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, fee repayment can be entered into the system in two ways: </p>
<ul>
<li>Through the Apply payment option for a client/ center/ group.</li>
<li>Through Collection Sheet Entry</li>
</ul>
<p>The Apply payment feature can be used to collect fee payment before the meeting, on the day of meeting and back-dating of meeting.</p>
<p>Collection Sheet Entry cannot be used to make an early repayment of fee for a meeting date which has not occurred yet . It can either collect payments on the day of the meeting or it can be used to collect back-dated payments before the next meeting date. </p>
<p>The next section describes the process of applying fee repayment through apply payment and collection sheet entry.</p>
<p>For each of the below scenarios, let's assume the following scenario:  The entity (client, group, or center) has a monthly meeting date of Dec 5.  You would like to apply and collect a fee either before this meeting date or on the day of the meeting.</p>
<p>Without the early repayment capability, any fees applied wouldn't be able to be collected until the next meeting date.</p>

<p>The steps below outline in detail the process you would follow to complete each of these scenarios.</p>
<p>Additional scenarios including back-dating of fees are covered in detail on the <a href="http://mifosforge.jira.com/wiki/display/MIFOS/Early+Repayment+of+Fees" title="Functional Spec: Early Repayment of Fees">Early Repayment of Fees functional specification</a>.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">Early fee repayment through apply payment: </span></p>
<p>When a payment is made at the center/group/client level, the payment applies only to fees. The sections below describe how early fee repayment can be made through apply payment feature.</p>
<h3><strong>Early fee repayment at the Center Level </strong></h3>
<p>When a payment is made at the center level, the payment applies only to fees. To make an early fee repayment at the center level, select the center for which the fee needs to be collected. This can be done as follows:</p>
<p>1. In any search box type the name of the center for which you want a fee applied and click <strong>Search</strong>. The center(s) matching the search string you provided will be displayed. The page will look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="static/center%20search.png" /> </p>
<p> 2. Select the required center. A screen similar to the following will be displayed:</p>
<p> <img src="static/center%20details.png" /> </p>
<p>  <img src="static/center%20account%20info.png" /></p>
<p>      <img src="static/center%20information.png" /> </p>
<p> 3. Under <strong>Center Charges</strong> in the <strong>Account Information</strong> section displayed above, click <strong>View Details</strong>. A screen with the following sections is displayed:</p>
<p><strong>Apply transactions</strong> - This section allows the user to enter loan repayment details (apply payment), modify entered loan repayment details (apply adjustment) and apply charges to the center like fee, penalty, etc (apply charges).</p>
<p><strong>Account Summary</strong> - This sections shows the amount due at the next installment, the amount overdue (unpaid at the previous installment) and the total.</p>
<p><strong>Upcoming charges</strong> - This section shows the charges that are due at the next repayment schedule.</p>
<p><strong>Recent Account Activity</strong> - As the name suggests, this section shows all recent activity by the center.</p>
<p><img src="static/center%20charges%20details.png" /> </p>
<p> 4. Click <strong>Apply Payment</strong>. This leads to a screen similar to the following:</p>
<p> <img src="static/apply%20payment.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Date of transaction</strong> - This records the date of the transaction. By default, it is set to the current date.</p>
<p><strong>Amount</strong> - This is amount of fee that is being repaid.</p>
<p><strong>Mode of payment</strong> - This is the mode in which repayment is made. Typical modes include Cash, Voucher, Cheque and MPESA.</p>
<p><strong>Receipt ID</strong> - If a receipt ID is used, it is entered here.</p>
<p><strong>Receipt Date</strong> - The receipt date, if a receipt was used, is entered here.</p>
<p>5. Enter the amount of  fee repaid. When payment is made, it is applied in the following order: all overdue charges are applied first followed by one-time fee followed by recurring fee.</p>
<p>6. System validations and other notes:  When an amount is entered, the system performs the following validations.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The amount entered should not be greater than the total fee owed by the client. In case the amount exceeds, the system throws an error message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The amount repaid can be less than the amount expected for that period. In this case, the system simply transfers the remaining unpaid amount towards the next payment (assessed as overdue charges)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of repayment of savings penalties too, if an amount less than the expected amount is repaid, the system simply considers it as a partial repayment of penalty. The balance amount now appears as the opening balance to be repaid by the client at the next meeting. Any amount greater than the required savings penalty is applied against fee repayment, if any. If there is no fee due, then the system throws an error for repayment of an amount greater than the expected amount.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As mentioned above, the fee payment is applied in the following order:</p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>Overdue charges</li>
<li>One-time fee</li>
<li>Recurring fee.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>          So, when a fee payment is made all overdue charges are repaid first. The remaining balance is adjusted against the one-time fee. If some balance still remains, it is adjusted against the number of recurring meetings for which the fee can be repaid. </p>
<p>Example: If overdue charges = 5, one-time fee = 10 and recurring fee = 2 for a period of 5 installments. Suppose the client makes a repayment of 19, then the amount is adjusted in the following manner.</p>
<ul>
<li>Overdue charges totalling 5 are repaid first. So, the remaining balance is 19-5 = 14.</li>
<li>The one-time fee of 10 is repaid next. Remaining balance = 14-10 = 4</li>
<li>The balance of 4 can be applied against 2 schedules of recurring fee. The balance remaining is now 0.</li>
<li>The fee amount owed by the client is now equal to the remaining recurring fee (2 * remaining 3 installments = 6). This amount is displayed by default as the opening balance amount to be repaid by the client.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<p>7. Click <strong>Review Transaction</strong> and if you are satisfied with the updates, click <strong>Submit.</strong> Else, click the <strong>Edit</strong> button and modify the transaction details.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<h3><strong>Early fee repayment at the Group Level </strong></h3>
<p>When a payment is made at the group level, the payment applies only to fees. To make an early fee repayment at the group level, select the group for which the fee needs to be collected. There are two ways you can do this:</p>
<p>1. As mentioned in the section &quot;Early repayment at the Center Level&quot;, in any search box enter the name of the group and click <strong>Search</strong>. The group(s) matching the search string provided are displayed. Select the required group.</p>
<p>2. Alternately, if you know the center to which the particular group belongs, select the center as described in the previous section. A screen like this will be displayed, with the list of groups assigned to the Center.</p>
<p><img src="/mifos-user-manual/edit/static/center%20details.png" /></p>
<p>Select the required group. The rest of the procedure is the same as described for the Center. Follow steps 3-5 outlined in the previous section &quot;Early fee repayment at the Center Level&quot;.</p>
<p>The validations performed at the group level are also similar to that at the center level.</p>
<h3><strong>Early fee repayment at the Client Level </strong></h3>
<p>This is very similar to what has been outlined in the above two sections. The client can either be located through a search or by selecting the group to which the client belongs and then selecting the client from that group. In the case of the latter, a screen similar to the following is displayed. The client can then be selected from the list of clients assigned.</p>
<p><img src="/mifos-user-manual/edit/static/client%20assigned.png" /> </p>
<p>After selecting the client, follow steps 2-5 outlined above for the remaining process of applying an early fee  repayment at the client level.</p>
<p>The validations performed are similar to that at the center level.</p>
<p>Note: In case a particular client has both penalty and fee due, then the repayment is applied in the following order: penalty is repaid first and if there is excess balance, the fee is repaid.</p>
<h2>Early fee repayment through Collection Sheet Data: </h2>
<h3><span class="Apple-style-span">The collection sheet is set up to make your collections easy. After you type in the information for the branch, loan officer, date and mode of payment, you see a form that already includes all payments and deposits that are expected on that date. </span></h3>
<p>As already mentioned, collection sheet entry cannot be used to make early repayment of fee for a meeting which has not occurred yet. It can only be used to make payment on the day of the meeting or back-dated payments before the next meeting date.</p>
<p>If unfamiliar with using Collection Sheet Entry, please visit the <em><a href="http://en.flossmanuals.net/mifos-user-manual/ch055_how-to-enter-collection-sheet-data/" title="How to Enter Collection Sheet Data">How to enter collection sheet data</a></em> section of the User Manual.  </p>
<p>To access the collection sheet entry page, click <strong>Clients and Accounts &gt; Enter Collection Sheet Data</strong> and a screen similar to the following will be displayed:<img src="/mifos-user-manual/edit/static/Mifos-mifoscollsheet1-en.png" alt="mifoscollsheet1.png" width="517" height="388" /></p>
<div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
Once you've clicked through <strong>Continue,</strong> a screen appears summarizing all the accounts at this branch whose collections fall on the day you specified. It might look like the following: <img src="/mifos-user-manual/edit/static/Mifos-mifoscollsheet2a-en.png" title="mifoscollsheet2a" alt="mifoscollsheet2a" width="522" height="431" /><img src="/mifos-user-manual/edit/static/Mifos-mifoscollsheet2b-en.png" title="mifoscollsheet2b" alt="mifoscollsheet2b" width="512" height="431" />
</li>
<li>
The relevant fields for applying fees will be in the following columns:
</li>
<ul>
<li>To enter the early fee repayment for a particular client/ group/ center, enter the respective fee amount against that client/ group/ center under the <strong>A/C collections</strong> column. This field is pre-populated with the list of charges/ fee assessed against the client/ center/ group. Enter the fee amount repaid by the client. A validation is performed by the system to make sure the amount entered is not greater than the fees due.</li>
<li>To enter penalty for withdrawal against a savings account at the client level, enter the required penalty amount against the client in the <strong>A/C collections</strong> column. The field is pre-populated with the required penalty amount.</li>
<li>Note: Loan fees (which don't have the early repayment capability) will show up under <strong>Due/Collections</strong> containing the short names of each loan and/or savings product appear.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>To understand the capability of the new early repayment of fees features, let's revisit our original example.  Assume you have a client whose monthly meeting date is Dec 5.  On Dec 5 (the day of the meeting) you would like to assess a client fee of 10. You manually apply the fee to the client. In the Collection Sheet Entry page for Dec 5, this fee of 10 will show up under the A/C collections column.</p>
<p>Prior to the early repayment of fees functionality, after applying the fee manually to the client on Dec 5, this would not show up on the Collection Sheet Entry page until the next meeting date of Jan 5. </p>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">System validations and other notes:</span>  When an amount is entered, the system performs the following validations.</p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The amount entered should not be greater than the total fee owed by the client. In case the amount exceeds, the system throws an error message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The amount repaid can be less than the amount expected for that period. In this case, the system simply transfers the remaining unpaid amount towards the next payment (assessed as overdue charges)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of repayment of savings penalties too, if an amount less than the expected amount is repaid, the system simply considers it as a partial repayment of penalty. The balance amount now appears as the opening balance to be repaid by the client at the next meeting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As mentioned above, the fee payment is applied in the following order:</p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>Overdue charges</li>
<li>One-time fee</li>
<li>Recurring fee.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
However, in case of collection sheet entry, only payments on the meeting date or backdated payments before the meeting date is allowed.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Recurring fee payment for a meeting date which has not occurred yet is not allowed. Only backdated recurring fee for an already elapsed period or recurring fee for the current meeting date is allowed. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So, in the case of repayment through CSE, when a fee payment is made, all overdue charges are repaid first. The remaining balance is adjusted against the one-time fee, provided the repayment date is for a period already elapsed or if repayment is scheduled for the current meeting date. Recurring fee for future meeting dates are not accepted by the system. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>: If overdue charges = 5, one-time fee = 10 repayable on the first installment meeting and recurring fee = 2 for a period of 5 installments. Suppose the client makes a repayment of 19 on the meeting date of the first installment, then the amount is adjusted in the following manner.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Overdue charges totalling 5 are repaid first. So, the remaining balance is 19-5 = 14.</li>
<li>The one-time fee of 10 is repaid next. Remaining balance = 14-10 = 4</li>
<li>The balance of 4 can be applied against only 1 schedule of recurring fee since the other recurring fees are for period that haven't occurred yet. Thus, the system accepts only 2 as recurring fee and throws an error saying the amount entered is greater than expected.</li>
</ul>

<span>How automatic late penalties are calculated</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span>Penalty is calculated at the end of the day (EOD) by the batch jobs and it is based on the criteria defined on the penalty:</span><br />
<span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Grace period type</span></li>
<li><span>Grace period duration         </span></li>

<span></span><br />
<span>If repayment of instalment is specified on the day and it won’t be repaid on this day, then, after a period time defined for this penalty (daily, weekly, monthly), penalty is calculated and applied by batch jobs.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span>Example:</span><br />
<span>Weekly loan has defined penalties amount (fixed $5) with weekly application frequency and Grace period time type: ‘Number of installments=1’. </span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span>Repayment is set on 01/04/2012 with amount $450. If repayment is not paid, then at the end of the day (01/04/2012), the daily batch jobs runs but the penalty is not calculated as there is a grace period time defined. </span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span>Amount due on 01/05/2012 is still $450. If the loan installment continues to remain unpaid until 01/11/2012, the batch job adds $5 to penalty column as the first time penalty amount. </span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span>Loan due on 01/12/2012 is: $450+$5+$450=$905.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span>If you want to see applied penalties click on </span><span>Clients&amp;Accounts &gt;</span><span> Select Loan account with 'Active in Bad standing' status. Under Account summary click on </span><span>View repayment schedule </span><span>to see a screen like following.  </span></p>

<p>Checklists are lists of things that should be done before an action is completed.</p>
<p>If you have the appropriate permissions, you can set up checklists that your users will see every time they start an action, such as approving a loan. The checklist serves as a reminder to the user to see that all processes are completed. Checklists are defined by the head office and associated with certain states of customer records or accounts.</p>
<p>For example, if the head office defines a checklist for the state “Pending approval” of a loan account, every time a user attempts to change the state of a loan account to “Pending Approval” (no matter what the state of the loan application was up to this point), the checklist appears.</p>
<p>The user can then go through the list and make sure that all items on the checklist have been satisfied. Each state for clients, groups, and products can only have one checklist attached.<br />

<p>For all kinds of payments (fees from clients/groups/centers, loan disbursements/repayments, and savings withdrawal/deposits), you can specify what forms of payments you will accept. By default, Mifos puts cash, cheque, and voucher as accepted choices. You could specify additional payment types to choose from as well (click <strong>Admin</strong> &gt; <strong>Define Lookup Options</strong> to do this). Once you have defined them as lookup options, you can decide which ones are accepted at present, and you can change these choices at any time.</p>

<h2>How to define customized labels</h2>
<div>
<p><span>This feature allows Mifos users to customize existing text based on their respective organizational needs and other regional preferences. For example, all labels in the Mifos system marked as “Center” could be replaced as “Kendra” (which is the Hindi term for Center). The following steps detail how this can be achieved:</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span>1. Go to </span><span><strong>Admin&gt;</strong> in <strong>Data Display and Rules</strong> section choose <strong>Define Customized Text</strong></span><span>. A screen similar to the following is displayed</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span><img src="static/define%20customized%20text.png" /></span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span>2. Click </span><span><strong>Add</strong></span><span>. A screen similar to the following is displayed.</span><br />
<span><img src="static/add%20custom%20text.png" /></span><br />
<span>Two fields are displayed:</span></p>
<p><span>Original Text:</span><span> This refers to the text that needs to be replaced. In the scenario discussed above, the original text would read &quot;Center&quot;.</span><br />
<span>Custom Text:</span><span> This refers to the text that the original text needs to be replaced with. </span><span class="Apple-style-span">In the scenario discussed above, the custom text would read &quot;Kendra&quot;</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span>Enter the required values for both fields and click </span><span>Submit</span><span>.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span>3. The Define customized text screen which previously was unpopulated now contains the customization that was defined and added to the system. A screen similar to the following is displayed.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span><img src="static/define%20cust%20text%20populated.png" /></span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span>In this case, Center is the old label which has now been replaced by ‘Kendra’. If satisfied with the changes made, click </span><span>Done</span><span>. This will replace all occurrences of “Center” in the system with “Kendra”.</span><span></span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span>4. To check if the changes have been effected, go to the Clients and Accounts page by clicking on the “</span><span>Clients and Accounts</span><span>” tab. Center has now been replaced by Kendra as displayed in the screenshot below.</span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span><img src="static/validate%20text.png" /></span><br />
<span></span><br />
<span>Note</span><span>: The customized text is case sensitive and all references will be replaced.</span><br />
</p>
</div>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">For example: If the original text is &quot;client&quot; and the custom text is &quot;member&quot;, then &quot;client&quot; will be replaced with &quot;member&quot; throughout. In addition, &quot;clients&quot; will be replaced with &quot;members&quot;. However, &quot;Client&quot; will not be replaced with &quot;Member&quot;.</span> </p>
<p>  <span>5. If you want to change your entries, mark an item from the list, click <strong>Edit.</strong></span></p>
<p> <img src="static/define%20custom%20txt.png" /></p>
<p><span>You may see a screen like following:</span></p>
<p><img src="static/edit%20custom%20txt.png" /><br />
</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><strong>Original text</strong> field is not editable. Change a text in <strong>Custom Text</strong> field on appropriate one and click <strong>Submit</strong> <span lang="zxx"><span>if you are satisfied with your entried or click </span></span><span lang="zxx"><strong>Cancel</strong> </span><span lang="zxx"><span>if you do not want to change anyting at this time</span></span>. </span></p>
<p><span>6. If you want to delete previously defined customize text, choose and mark an item to delete, then click on <strong>Remove</strong> <span>button. A definition of customize text will disappears from the list.</span></span></p>
<p> <img src="static/define%20text.png" /></p>
<h2><span id="ch022_how-to-set-rules-for-data-display.xhtml#define-change-lookup-options">How to define and change lookup options</span></h2>
<p>In many procedures within Mifos, you choose among items in a list. These are called &quot;lookup options.&quot; For some of these lists, you can control the items that appear there to fit your local circumstances, either by adding new options or editing the existing ones. For example, in the list of salutations, you might want to add &quot;Sri&quot; or &quot;Rev.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: You can add new lookup options or edit the ones that appear there, but you may not delete any.</p>
<p>Follow these instructions to change lookup options:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Click <strong>Admin</strong> &gt; <strong>Define Lookup Options</strong>.<br />
A screen appears showing all current lookup options for lists that you can change. This screen (in two pieces) looks like this:<br />
<img src="static/Mifos-mifoslookup1-en.png" alt="mifoslookup1.png" width="296" height="713" /><br />
<img src="static/Mifos-mifoslookup2-en.png" alt="mifoslookup2.png" width="296" height="691" /><br />
</li>
<li>To add a lookup option, click that option and click <strong>Add</strong>.<br />
A screen appears with an empty box for that option.</li>
<li>Type the new option and click <strong>Submit</strong>.</li>
<li>To edit a lookup option, click that option and click <strong>Edit</strong>.<br />
A screen appears with a box showing the current option.</li>
<li>Type the changed option and click <strong>Submit</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2><span id="ch022_how-to-set-rules-for-data-display.xhtml#mandatory-hidden-fields">How to specify that fields be mandatory and/or hidden</span></h2>
<p>For many of the fields in Mifos, if you have the appropriate permissions, you can decide whether a field is mandatory (meaning that the procedure cannot be completed until this field is filled in) and also whether a field is hidden. For example, if it is essential to fill in the purpose of a loan before that loan is granted, you can mark the &quot;Purpose of loan&quot; field as mandatory. If a field such as &quot;Address 3&quot; is unnecessary, you can mark it as hidden.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: Before marking a field as hidden, be sure that you will not need it later. MFI records that were created when the field was hidden may be different from those that are created later when the field is visible, and this can create problems.</p>
<p>Follow these instructions to make the specifications:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Click <strong>Admin</strong> &gt; <strong>Define Mandatory/Hidden Fields</strong>.<br />
A screen appears showing all fields for which you can make these specifications. These are grouped:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Fields that are systemwide (they appear everywhere in Mifos)</li>
<li>Fields that are filled with information about clients and system users</li>
<li>Fields that are filled with information about groups</li>
<li>Fields that are used for loan accounts<br />
The screen looks like this:<br />

<li>Check and uncheck the boxes according to your preferences.</li>
<li>When you are satisfied with your specifications, click <strong>Submit</strong>. (If you decide not to change the status of any fields at this time, click <strong>Cancel</strong>.)</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note</em>: If you make a field mandatory, it will always have an asterisk (*) next to it.</p>

<p>Most MFIs have savings products and loan products. In addition, you can define subcategories of these products. These can be useful in your reports, if you want to compare the repayment rates and profitability of different kinds of loans. For example, you might want to create an &quot;Income-generating loan&quot; category that is used to report on loans for business. You could create different products within this category such as &quot;Farm loan&quot; and &quot;Food kiosk loan.&quot; A second category, &quot;Housing loan,&quot; might contain different products for &quot;Standard housing loans&quot; and &quot;Tsunami rebuilding loans.&quot; Then you could compare the categories to see which were the most popular and the most profitable.</p>

<p>In Mifos, a loan <em>product</em> is a type of loan account. A single MFI typically has several loan products--for example, a 4-year housing loan, and a 2-year educational loan. The product provides the terms and definitions of these different programs to the Mifos system. Loan products are available to the whole MFI.</p>
<p>If a customer wants to borrow a 2-year educational loan, the MFI uses the 2-year educational loan to create an account for the customer. The loan account is used to track transactions related to the loan, which include interest, repayment, and any applicable charges. The loan account is a specific instance of a loan product, with a specified interest rate and an account number, and it is owned by a specified MFI customer.</p>
<p>For example, Rashmi and Shalini might both have loans for income-generating businesses. They are separate accounts (they have different account numbers and different balances), but both loans are instances of the same product (they were authorized by loan officers under the same program and share common traits, such as the way that the proceeds are used, the way interest is calculated, and the general ledger entries they are posted to). Although the terms of a loan account are governed by the product definition, the loan officer may have some flexibility to change interest rates and other attributes. Therefore, many of the properties of a loan product define the minimum and maximum values that the user may choose when an account of that type is opened.</p>
<p>The purpose of a product is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>To offer MFI personnel a menu of choices of predefined services to offer clients, and the range of legal parameters where variation is permitted.</li>
<li>To define a link to the accounting system, so that disbursements and receipts can be credited to the proper general ledger account.</li>
<li>To provide a grouping of different accounts that should be combined for reporting purposes. Before you can make individual loans, you must define a loan product. All individual loans created from the same product have the same basic attributes.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note</em>: If you want to see the loan products that have already been created before you make a new one, click <strong>Admin</strong> &gt; <strong>View Loan Products</strong> and click any of the products displayed on that screen.</p>

<p> An additional field titled 'Can waive interest on Prepay Loan' is displayed. Information on its significance and how the feature can be enabled is discussed in the next section.</p>
<span id="ch027_how-to-define-new-and-change-existing-loan-products.xhtml#waive-interest"></span>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">Waive Interest on Loan Repayment </span></p>
<p>Mifos provides MFIs the option to waive interest during repayment of certain Loan products. In some cases, this is used to reward clients who repay loans earlier than the required date. When MFIs exercise this option to waive interest for a certain product type, clients repaying loans of that specific product type are not charged interest for the current active instalment. Otherwise, when a client repays a loan, interest is captured for the current active instalment as well.</p>
<p>If the option to waive interest is not enabled, the loan amount due is calculated as follows:</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Amount due =</p>
<p>        All installments unpaid + Current installment due + Future Principle amounts only.  </p>
<p>This feature can be specified for new as well as existing loan products.</p>
<p><strong>To enable feature for new loan products:</strong> Follow steps detailed in above section to define new loan product.  To select the 'Can Waive Interest on Prepay Loan' option for the loan in question, mark the corresponding check box as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="static/waive%20interest.png" /><br />
</p>
<p> By default, this feature is not enabled.</p>
<p><strong>To enable feature for existing loan products:</strong> Select the existing loan product for which the interest needs to be waived. To do this, follow these instructions:</p>

<p><span class="Apple-style-span">How to create Variable Installment Loans</span></p>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> Often times, MFIs face the need to tailor loan disbursement, loan repayment recovery and loan maturity to suit the cash flow patterns of the borrower. This is especially true of products like agricultural loans where clients repayments can be quite volatile. The volatility arises due to increased vulnerability of the agricultural industry to factors like inclement weather. Consequently returns in such sectors are seasonal, unpredictable and often lower than those of the regular commercial enterprises for which MFIs disburse loans. This necessitates the need for MFIs to have customized loans products, which allow for more flexibility with the installment schedule. </p>
<p>The Variable Installment Loans feature of Mifos enables MFIs to accommodate this flexibility by specifying different gaps between installments, as explained in the How to Manage Variable Loan Installments section.    </p>
<p>The next section deals with any fees that are attached to this loan.</p>

<h2><span id="ch029_how-to-view-system-information-and-manage-a-mifos-shut-down.xhtml#view-system-info">How to view system information</span></h2>
<p>At any point, you can check the basic information about the system you are using to run Mifos. Click <strong>Admin</strong> &gt; <strong>View System Information</strong> to see items such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operating system version</li>
<li>Application server version</li>
<li>Database server name</li>
</ul>
<h2><span id="ch029_how-to-view-system-information-and-manage-a-mifos-shut-down.xhtml#manage-mifos-shutdown">How to manage a Mifos shutdown</span></h2>
<p>When you need to shut down Mifos (for upgrades or maintenance, for example), you must give users a chance to finish their work first, and you must prevent any new users from logging on. For that reason, the process includes ways to see how many users are currently working and to notify them of the shutdown.</p>
<p>To manage the shutdown of Mifos, follow these instructions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Click <strong>Admin</strong> &gt; <strong>Shutdown</strong>.<br />
A screen like the following appears:<br />
<img src="static/Mifos-mifosshutdown-en.png" title="mifosshutdown" alt="mifosshutdown" width="443" height="253" /><br />
<br />
The <strong>Shutdown Status</strong> shows whether a shutdown of the system is planned or not. The <strong>Active Sessions</strong> section shows you the names of all system users logged on, their branch office, and the action or page they are involved in in Mifos. When you start a shutdown of Mifos, all active sessions will see a notification at the top of their screens indicating that a shutdown is imminent.</li>
<li>To be sure that you are seeing all active sessions of Mifos, click the <strong>Refresh</strong> button.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Schedule In</strong> box, type the number of seconds' delay until Mifos shuts down.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Start Shutdown</strong>.<br />
In the specified number of seconds, all active sessions of Mifos will have to complete their work, and no new sessions can be started. If you need to cancel this operation, click <strong>Cancel Shutdown</strong>. Active users will then be able to continue their sessions, and new users can log on.<br />
<br />
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that all sessions have shut down, the Mifos administrator can stop the entire Mifos application.</p>

<p>Before you can create individual savings accounts, you must define a savings product. All savings accounts are created from these products and inherit their characteristics.</p>
<p>Savings products can be set up for mandatory or voluntary deposits. If the account holder does not make any deposits to or withdrawals from the account in a certain period of time (the default is 30 days), the account becomes dormant.</p>
<p> <em>Note</em>: If you want to see the savings products that have already been created before making a new one, click <strong>Admin</strong> &gt; <strong>View Savings Products</strong> and click any of the products displayed on that screen. From that display, you can make changes to the existing savings products.</p>

<h1>Centers, groups, and clients: Overview</h1>
<p>Below the level of the branch, your MFI can have centers and groups to organize and empower clients. Usually, a single Loan Officer works in a center and has responsibility for several groups. If there is a center, it determines the meeting schedule (if there is one) for all the groups contained in it. (Otherwise, the branch does this.)</p>
<p>Groups include clients; they can sometimes act as a unit, as in the case where a group has a savings or loan account, and all clients in that group contribute to it.</p>
<p>Clients can act on their own, with individual savings and loan accounts, or they can act as part of a group.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span id="ch033_how-to-create-a-new-center.xhtml"></span></p>
<h1>How to create a new center</h1>
<p>A center is a collection of many groups. It is associated with a branch office. A center can have a savings account, like a group or a client. Groups or clients associated with that center can make deposits to and withdrawals from such an account, and the center can also pay fees for accounts.</p>

<p>The group can act to borrow money and hold a savings account, as if it were an individual client. It can also have an account for group fees (for membership, loan applications, and so forth). A group can have positions such as President and Treasurer that are assigned to group members.</p>

<h1>How to create a new client</h1>
<p>The individual client can have savings accounts and borrow money according to the rules of your MFI. If the client is associated with a group, that client inherits the loan officer, the meeting schedule, and the meeting location of the group.</p>
<p>Follow these instructions to create a client account.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Click <strong>Clients &amp; Accounts</strong>. In the left navigation panel, click <strong>Create New Client</strong>.</p>

<li>In the <strong>Group Name</strong> box, type the name of the group that this client is assigned to, and click Proceed. A list of groups by that name appears; click the correct one. If the correct group name is not on this list (perhaps you mistyped it?), type the group name again and click <strong>Search</strong> to try again. When you see the correct group name, click it.</li>
<li><p>If group membership is not required for your client, click that link to proceed.<br />

<ul>
<li>Any periodic fee linked to the center record is not stopped.</li>
<li>Transactions can still be made.</li>
<li>A miscellaneous penalty or any amount that is due remains due.</li>
<li>The system will not allow users to apply any periodic fee type to the account except for an upfront fee and any miscellaneous penalty fees.</li>

<h1>How to attach and collect Question Groups</h1>
<div>
<p>Question Groups are ways for loan officers and others working in the branch to collect information about groups and clients. These question groups can include demographic information (income, family size, types of business) that might change over time, and they enable you to know your clients and serve their needs better. The process of attaching question groups is the same for centers, groups, and clients. The example used here is for a center.</p>
<p>Center workers can ask the question groups directly from the computer screen, or they can print a copy of the question groups and take it directly to the client. If they use a paper copy of the question group, they must enter the answers in the computer later.</p>
<p>To create a new question group, follow the instructions in <a href="http://en.flossmanuals.net/mifos-user-manual/how-to-add-and-edit-a-question/">How to create a new question group.</a></p>
<p>When you are ready to use the question group online (or to enter question group data from the printed copy), follow these instructions.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In any Search box, type the name of a center, group, or client and click Search.</li>
<li>In the list that appears, click the link for the correct center, group, or client.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Center Details</strong> screen, click <strong>Attach a Question Group</strong>.<br />
A screen like the following appears:<br />
<img src="static/attachQG.png" /><br />
</li>
<li>In the <strong>Select Question Group</strong> list, click the Question Group you want to enter data for and click <strong>Continue</strong>. (You can see only the QG that are available for this center.) The online form of the QG might appear like this screen:<br />
<img src="static/QG%20data.png" /><br />
</li>
<li>Click or type a response to each question. If the question is mandatory, you may not finish the question group until the question is answered.</li>
<li>When you have answered all questions, click <strong>Submit</strong>.</li>
<li>In the Question Group box, the name and date of the QG now appear. To see details of that QG, click the name of the QG, you may also edit your answer if you click <strong>Edit</strong>.</li>

<div>
<h2><span id="ch043_introduction-to-loan-accounts.xhtml#what">What is a loan account?</span></h2>
<p>A single MFI typically has several loan products, for example, a 4-year housing loan, and a 2-year educational loan. The product provides the terms and definitions of these different programs to the Mifos system. Loan products are available to the whole MFI.</p>
<p>If a customer wants to have a 2-year educational loan, the MFI uses the 2-year educational loan to create an account for the customer. The loan account is used to track transactions related to the loan, which include interest, repayment, and any applicable charges. The loan account is a specific instance of a loan product, with a specified interest rate and an account number, and it is owned by a specified MFI customer.</p>
<h2><span id="ch043_introduction-to-loan-accounts.xhtml#group-vs-client-loans">Group loans versus client loans</span></h2>
<p>If your MFI is structured to have groups as well as clients, you have a choice of issuing group loans or individual loans. With group loans, the group as a whole is responsible for repayment and fees, and each individual in the group has a designated responsibility to pay their part of the debt.</p>
<p>The benefits of the group include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>By vouching for other members of the group, the group does the work of checking the creditworthiness of each individual in the group.</li>
<li>By co-signing the loan, the group provides insurance of payment by individuals.</li>
<li>The group provides reinforcement, esprit de corps, and encouragement to individuals to bear their part of the debt responsibility.</li>
</ul>

<h3 lang="en-US">Missed Installments</h3>
<p>If a client or group misses payment for an installment, the same amount is included in the next installment due. For example, if the client has to repay $100 (principal = $80 and interest = $20) every month, and he or she defaults for the month of August, then for the month of September, the installment due (including penalty) is $202. The following computation shows how the $202 is arrived at:</p>
<p>Principal due $80</p>
<p>Interest due $20</p>
<p>Penalty due $2 (for the missed/defaulted installment)</p>
<p>Principal overdue $80 (for the missed/defaulted installment)</p>
<p>Interest overdue $20 (for the missed/defaulted installment)</p>
<p>Total amount due $202</p>
<p>Partial payments are accepted.</p>
<h2><span id="ch043_introduction-to-loan-accounts.xhtml#glim">Group loans individual monitoring (GLIM)</span></h2>
<p>Mifos currently offers two major types of loans, individual and group. In an individual loan, the individual is totally responsible for repayment of the loan and for payment of any associated fees. In a group loan, the group has a single loan account, and the group is the primary unit that the MFI interacts with; a single repayment schedule is maintained for the entire group. The group provides credit worthiness to all its members; if one member is delinquent in the group, then all the contracting group members are also considered delinquent.</p>
<p>If your MFI wants to do things differently-that is, if it wants to keep the credit worthiness of each individual in a group loan separate-it can use GLIM (group loans individual monitoring), which calculates performance history separately for each individual participating in a group loan.</p>
<p>With a GLIM loan, the group is still the primary unit that participates in transactions, but the performance history of each contracting member is calculated in a slightly different way when compared to how it is calculated for a regular group loan.</p>
<p>In a GLIM loan, all transactions (disbursals, payments, adjustments, bulk entry, and so forth) take place at the group level. The only major difference between GLIM and the usual group loans is that the initial loan account creation specifies the amounts given to each individual, the purposes for these amounts, and the way these loans affect the calculation of individual performance metrics.</p>
<p>Payments made on the GLIM loan are applied to Group loan account and also pro-rated across the individual schedule of every Group member.<br />
</p>
<p><em>Note</em><strong>:</strong> At the time of configuration, you must decide whether your group loans will be standard or will use GLIM. Once set, this option cannot be changed after deploying Mifos.</p>

<li>Group loan with individual monitoring (GLIM) </li>
</ul>
<p>You can create individual loans for clients and for groups. All the loan products defined by your MFI are available for use, and you can adjust the amount of these loans in the ranges set for those products. You can also define and adjust the interest rate for each loan, choose options for the payment schedule, set a grace period (extra time for repayment), set fees in addition to the loan repayment, choose the fund that this loan comes from, and associate the loan with your general ledger codes.</p>
<p>Note: If you want to make several loans at the same time to clients or groups, see <a href="http://en.flossmanuals.net/HowToCreateBulkMultipleLoans">How to create multiple loans (bulk loan creation).</a></p>
<p>Loans can be held by clients and groups. To create a new loan for one of these, you must navigate to the details page for that customer. You can do this in several ways:</p>
<p>From the Home screen search function</p>
<p><img src="static/Mifos-mifoshomesearch-en.png" alt="mifoshomesearch.png" width="408" height="210" /></p>
<p>From the Quick Start left navigation list (click <strong>Open New Loan Account</strong>)</p>
<p><img src="static/Mifos-mifosquickstart-en.png" alt="mifosquickstart.png" width="171" height="185" /></p>
<p>From the Clients &amp; Accounts left navigation panel (click <strong>Create Loan Account</strong>)</p>
<p><img src="static/Mifos-mifoscaquickstart-en.png" alt="mifoscaquickstart.png" width="158" height="302" /></p>
<p>From the Clients &amp; Accounts main panel (click a <strong>Branch Office</strong> from the list on the right to narrow down the search for the customer)</p>
<p><img src="static/Mifos-mifoscamainquickstart-en.png" alt="mifoscamainquickstart.png" width="554" height="230" /></p>
<p>All these methods ask for the name, system ID, or account number for a group or client. When you type this information and click <strong>Search</strong>, you see a list of all possible choices for your search information. Click the correct one, or (if you don't see the customer you were expecting) try retyping the search information carefully and then click <strong>Search</strong> again.</p>
<p><em>Once you see the details page for a customer (group or client), the procedure is the same.</em> This example shows how to create a loan for a client.</p>
<p><em>Note</em> : By default, repayments are due on center meeting dates. If you have specified an LSIM arrangement during configuration, you will see a box in which you can specify a repayment day that is different from the meeting day of the client's center. See <a href="http://en.flossmanuals.net/bin/view/Mifos/Howtocreateanewloanaccount#lsim">Loan schedule independent of meeting</a> for information about LSIM.</p>

<p>9 After creating Loan, you need to change the status of the account. To do that click on <strong>Edit account status</strong> link and then select appropriate account state.</p>
<p>In some situations, there can be a need to back date transactions and record disbursements that have happened in the past. To do that, just enter the past date (which can be before creation date) and then approve account. Disbursal would still follow the rule that it must happen on or after the date of the approval.<br />
<br />
NOTE: To be able to approve loans in the past, 'Back-date approvals' and 'BackDatedApprovalsAllowed' option should be enabled in Mifos configuration file.</p>

<h2><span id="ch044_how-to-create-a-new-loan-account.xhtml#lsim">Loan schedule independent of meeting (LSIM)</span></h2>
<div>
<p>If your MFI intends to collect loan payments on nonmeeting days, it can set up this LSIM system to adjust the repayment schedule.</p>
<p>During the configuration process, the Allow Payments on Nonmeeting Days setting is turned on.</p>
<p>Then, in Mifos, you see the following differences when you create a loan:</p>
<p>· Ordinarily, the default disbursal date is the next meeting date. If LSIM is activated, however, you can change this date to something else. However, this disbursal date must be in the future.</p>
<p>· You can also change the default repayment day to a nonmeeting day (in the Repayment Day field), but it must occur at the same frequency as meeting days (that is, if the meeting occurs once a month, the repayment day must be once a month). You may not change the frequency of repayments.</p>
<p>Mifos calculates the repayment schedule, including grace periods, based on these dates.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>How to create loans of multiple frequencies</h2>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span"><span id="ch044_how-to-create-a-new-loan-account.xhtml#internal-source-marker_0.9793607026804239">This feature allows MFIs to give clients loans of different frequencies. Previously, Mifos allowed only loan products that matched the frequency of a client’s meeting schedule to be disbursed. </span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span>For example, a client that had weekly meetings was not allowed to have monthly loans. </span></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><span>In other words, if a client’s meeting schedule was set to &quot;weekly&quot;, only loan products that had repayments scheduled every N weeks could be disbursed. Thus, meeting schedule was a rigid constraint in Mifos. This new feature serves to remove some of that rigidity.</span></span></p>
<div>
<p><br />
<span>This feature only works when LSIM (Loan Schedule Independent of Meeting) is on. For details on enabling LSIM, look up <a href="http://en.flossmanuals.net/mifos-user-manual/how-to-create-a-new-loan-account/">here</a>. Since this only works when LSIM is enabled, its scope is restricted to only loans and does not affect customer account related aspects like savings and fees.</span></p>

<h2><strong>How to create a group loan with GLIM option enabled</strong></h2>
<p>Mifos provides extended Group Loan functionality (GLIM) which allows to track individual repayment schedules of every member of the Group Loan. To enable GLIM functionality you need to activate the right configuration option in the database (for more datails please refer to section about <span class="StrongEmphasis">Loan with Individual Monitoring on</span> <strong><a href="http://mifos.org/documentation/configuration#id30" class="uri">http://mifos.org/documentation/configuration#id30</a></strong>).</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> To check if GLIM is added properly, click <strong>Admin &gt; Organizational Settings.</strong> Under 'Miscellaneous' section find: Group loan with individual monitoring (GLIM) – it should be set to Yes<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Group loan with individual monitoring (GLIM) enables you to allocate principal amounts and select different loan purposes to individual group members. A loan is distributed to group and you are able to see not only group repayment schedule but also schedule for each individual group member.

<p>To approve (or cancel) a loan, follow these instructions:</p>
<ol>
<li>From any Search screen, search for the borrower name (client or group), or the loan account number if you know it.</li>
<li>In the list of clients or groups that appears, click the correct one.</li>
<li> In the Account Information section, find the loan you need to approve (all loans that need approval have a yellow square next to them). Click that link.</li>

<p>Sometimes, data entry errors result in loans that are created for the wrong client, or perhaps the wrong type of loan product is created for a client. The error might not be detected until several repayments have been made.</p>
<p>To correct this error, if you have the appropriate permissions, you can reverse the loan disbursal and all repayments made up to this point. This can happen only if the loan is in an &quot;Active in good standing&quot; or &quot;Active in bad standing&quot; state. (Afterward, if repayments have already been made, you can redo the disbursal by recreating the correct loan and applying all those repayments to it. Make a note of any repayments, so that you can apply them to the new loan. See <a href="http://en.flossmanuals.net/#redo-loan-disbursal">How to redo a loan disbursal</a></p>

<h2>How to apply payments via a savings transfer</h2>

<p><img src="static/applyTransfer.png" /><br />
<br />
After selecting '<em><strong>Transfer from Savings Account</strong></em>' as a mode of payment, the list of all active customer’s Savings accounts is displayed and you select any of them.<br />
<br />
NOTE: If you select Savings account with insufficient balance to repay loan, then validation message will appear once you try to submit transaction - &quot;<em>Insufficient Balance in savings account to make the payments</em>&quot;.<br />
<br />
If the amount entered is greater than the maximum amount per withdrawal limit on the savings account, an error message &quot;<em>The amount entered exceeds the maximum amount per withdrawal limit on the savings account</em>&quot;  is displayed.<br />
<br />

</p>
<h2><span id="ch048_how-to-make-transactions-for-a-loan-account.xhtml#apply-adjustments">How to apply adjustments</span></h2>
<p>Sometimes errors occur when payments for a loan are recorded. If you need to cancel the full amount of the last repayment, you can do this by making an &quot;adjustment.&quot; If you need to cancel several repayments, you must do each one separately. You have also a possibility to adjust historical transactions. If you have made incorrect transaction in the past, you can make adjustment of any transaction you want.<span id="ch048_how-to-make-transactions-for-a-loan-account.xhtml#internal-source-marker_0.7444926590476345"></span></p>
<p>When you have made an adjustment, Mifos divides the canceled payment into principal, interest, and fees, and makes adjustments in each of these categories to the total amount still due for the loan.</p>
<p>To apply adjustment, follow these instructions:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In the Transactions box at the upper right of the screen, click <strong>Apply Adjustment</strong>.<br />

<p> </p>
<p><img src="static/apply%20adjustment.png" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p> <br />
</p></li>
<li><p> Check the <strong>Check to Revert the Last Payment</strong> box, if you want to adjust full amount. </p>
<p><em>Note:</em> You may also adjust only part of amount. If you want to do so, do not check the <strong>Check to Revert the Last Payment</strong> box and specify <strong>Amount</strong> value which you want to adjust.</p></li>
<li><strong>Date of transaction</strong> is set on the current day, but you may change it to any date, and make adjustment not only of the last transaction, but also of transactions, made in the past.</li>
<li>Choose <strong>Mode of payment</strong> from the drop-down list<strong>.</strong><br />
</li>
<li>In the <strong>Notes</strong> box, type information describing why you made this adjustment.</li>
<li>When you have made the adjustment, click <strong>Review Adjustment</strong> to review your work and click <strong>Submit</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<h2><span id="ch048_how-to-make-transactions-for-a-loan-account.xhtml#repay-loan">How to repay a loan</span></h2>
<p>You can repay the entire remaining loan balance at once using the Repay Loan link.  After following these instructions, the status of the loan will change to &quot;Closed - Obligation Met&quot;.</p>
<p>Date of transaction is automatically set as current date, but you change it. If you forget to record the loan repayment on the day of the center meeting you may may specify a backdate of the repayment of a loan up in <strong>Date of transaction</strong> <span>field, but it can not be earlier then</span> date of the last payment or last meeting date.</p>

<h2><span>How to do an early repayment of Loan</span><br />
</h2>
<div>
<p><span>After a loan is disbursed, a client can make repayments at any time. The date of repayment need not necessarily be on the date the amount is due. The repayment can be either partial or a full repayment of the total amount outstanding. Depending on the type of loan repayment (whether full or partial), one of the following repay options is used in Mifos:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span>Repay Loan</span></p></li>
<li><p><span>Apply Payment</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p><br />
<span>Difference between Repay Loans and Apply Payments:</span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">Apply Payments: </span></p>
<p><span>This is used in case of partial repayment of loan amount, where the repay amount is not equal to the amount due on a specific date. In this case, details of this transaction can be recorded into the Mifos system by modifying the default amount and entering an amount less than the expected amount. Before processing and saving the transaction details, Mifos performs the following validations:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Date of transaction should be between the last payment date and current date</span></li>
<li><span>Amount entered is not greater than the total amount outstanding on that account.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><br />
<br />
<span>Repay Loans: </span><br />
<span>After loan disbursal, the client can at any time repay the entire loan in a single payment. To record a total repayment, the Repay Loans option is used. The system calculates the total amount due as of the current date as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Principal</span><span>: The principal is calculated as the sum total of principal due in unpaid, due and future installments.</span></li>
<li><span>Interest</span><span>: Interest is calculated depending on whether the waive interest feature is enabled - this is explained in greater detail in the next section.</span></li>
<li><span>Fees</span><span>: The fees due for all future installments is not included, but the fees due for all past unpaid installments and the current installment is included in the total due.</span></li>
<li><span>Penalty: </span><span><span class="Apple-style-span">This includes miscellaneous penalties and penalties due to late repayments, if any. The total includes miscellaneous penalties, both for the current </span><span class="Apple-style-span">instalment</span><span class="Apple-style-span"> and for those due through the last installment.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><br />
<br />
<span>Early repayment of Loans - Repay Loans and Waive Interest</span><br />
<br />
<span>Scenario: </span><span>If the client repays the loan earlier than the due date and the loan product has been marked as ‘Can Waive Off Interest’. </span><br />
<br />
<span>1. Click Repay Loan link on the Loan Details page (top right of the screen). A screen like the following appears:</span></p>
<p><br />
<span class="Apple-style-span"><img src="/mifos-user-manual/edit/static/waive%20interest%20-%20repay%20loans.png" /></span><span class="Apple-style-span"><br />
</span><span>2.  As shown in the screenshot above, the Can Waive Off Interest option is enabled. (This is because the loan product has been marked as Can Waive Off Interest). Depending on your MFI’s current requirement, you have the option to disable it or retain it.</span><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Waive Interest Option Disabled:</span><span> The Amount is calculated by waiving off all the future fee, future interests. The payment due interest is included in the calculate amount and the penalty is not waived off.</span></li>
</ul>
<span class="Apple-style-span"><br />
</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Waive Interest Option Enabled: </span><span>The Amount is calculated by waiving off all the future fee, future interests and the payment due interest. The penalty is not waived off.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><br />
<span>3. Select the appropriate mode of payment from the list provided. The receipt ID and receipt date are optional fields. After entering the required details, click </span><span>Review Transactions</span><span>. A screen like the following appears:</span><br />
<br />
<span class="Apple-style-span"><img src="/mifos-user-manual/edit/static/waive%20interest%20-%20review%20transaction.png" /><br />
</span><br />
<span>4. If any changes need to be made, click </span><span>Cancel</span><span>. This will direct back to the Loan Details page. Click </span><span>Repay Loan</span><span> again to make the necessary changes to the transaction. </span><br />
<span>If all details are in order, click </span><span>Submit</span><span>.</span><br />

<span class="Apple-style-span"><br />
</span><br />
<span>To further verify that the transaction has indeed been recorded as 'closed' by the Mifos system, check that the Loans Balance field in the Accounts Summary section reads 0 (refer screenshot above). </span><br />
<br />
<span>Click View Repayment Schedule (in the Accounts summary section). The Repayment schedule should display all installments under the Installments Paid section.</span><br />

<h2><strong>How to record and clear overpayment</strong></h2>
<p></a></span></p>
<div>
<strong></strong>
<p>Mifos provides possibility to make payment greater then remaining balance of the loan (an overpayment) by using import transaction functionality. Sometimes it is only a few dollars over, sometimes an entire extra installment is mistakenly paid. It may occur only during repayment of the last installment. Mifos validates loan balance and shows overpayment amount, which may be returned to clients. If overpayment is made, client's account automatically changes the status to ' <span id="ch048_how-to-make-transactions-for-a-loan-account.xhtml#loanaccountdetail.text.status1"></span>Closed- Obligation met' and the new section called 'Overpayments' on client's details page is displayed.</p>
<h3>How to import transaction with overpayment</h3>
<p>Import transactions functionality is possible only if Audi Bank plugin is available (it should be added into catalog Home &gt; .mifos &gt; plugins). Then you should import previously prepared Excel file (.xls) which contains loan payment transactions.</p>
<p>To import Excel file follow instructions below:</p>
1. At the beginning you must prepare Excel file, which contains transactions for actual client. Transaction may contain amount greater than last installment amount (an overpayment).<br />
2. Click on <strong>Admin</strong> tab. Under 'Manage Imports and Exports' section click on <strong>Import transactions</strong> link.
<p><em>Note:</em> You only can make an overpayment for client's last installment.</p>
<p>You will see following screen:</p>
<table>

<h2>How to create a Variable Installment Loan product </h2>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> Often times, MFIs face the need to tailor loan disbursement, loan repayment recovery and loan maturity to suit the cash flow patterns of the borrower. This is especially true of products like agricultural loans where clients repayments can be quite volatile. The volatility arises due to increased vulnerability of the agricultural industry to factors like inclement weather. Consequently returns in such sectors are seasonal, unpredictable and often lower than those of the regular commercial enterprises for which MFIs disburse loans. This necessitates the need for MFIs to have customized loans products, which allow for more flexibility with the installment schedule. </p>
<p>The Variable Installment Loans feature of Mifos enables MFIs to accommodate this flexibility by specifying different gaps between installments, as explained in the sections below.   </p>
<h3>Configuring variable installments when defining a new loan product.</h3>
<p>To configure variable installments, the checkbox 'Can configure variable installment' must be enabled.</p>
<p> <img src="static/checkbox.png" width="264" height="31" /></p>
<p>For the checkbox to be enabled, the following two conditions must be set:</p>
<ul>
<li>The loan product must have a ‘Declining balance' or 'Flat' selected in <strong>Interest rate type</strong> drop-down list:<br />
</li>
</ul>
<h1><img src="static/Mifos-mifosloanproduct3-en.png" /><br />
</h1>
<p></a></p>
<ul>
<li><span id="ch050_how-to-manage-variable-loan-installments.xhtml#variable-installment-product">Mifos should have the LSIM feature turned ON. LSIM stands for Loan Schedule Independent of Meeting and if this feature is enabled, repayment schedules and loan disbursals no longer need to coincide with meeting schedules. </span><a href="http://www.example.com/Link15">LSIM is set at the database level</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, when the LSIM feature is ON and the selected interest rate type is other than ‘declining’, ‘can configure variable installment’ checkbox will get disabled.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">How to configure variable installments when defining a new loan product.</span></p>
<p>1. Under section Repayment Schedule, check the 'Can configure variable installments' checkbox.</p>
<p>2. The following parameters will be displayed:</p>
<p>  <img src="static/configure%20variable%20installments.png" /><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Minimum Gap between Installments - </strong>This is the minimum gap, in days, that is required between two consecutive installments. This is a required field. </p>
<p><strong>Maximum Gap between Installments - </strong>This is the maximum gap, in days, between installments. This value is optional.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum Installment Amount -  </strong>The minimum amount that needs to be repaid at each installment. This value is optional. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Compare with Cash Flow settings:  </h3>
<p>Mifos provides MFIs the option to compare loan installments with customer's cash flow. This option allows MFIs to specify conditions with regard to customers' cash flow and loans are created in accordance with these conditions. This feature is available for loans with variable installment and without. </p>
<p>To enable comparison with cash flow, mark the checkbox 'Compare with Cash Flow'. The following parameters will be displayed:</p>
<p><img src="static/compare%20with%20cash%20flow.png" /> </p>
<p><strong>Warning Threshold - </strong>This value, expressed as a percentage, is the fraction of a customer's cumulative cash flow and the upper limit for loan installment for any period. In other words, this field will be used to alert a user if the loan installment for any period is above a certain percentage of the cumulative cash flow (cash flow calculation explained is explained in the following section). The warning threshold can be between 0 and 99% (It cannot be a 100% because it would then mean that loan installments for any period can be equal to a customer's cumulative cash flow).</p>
<p><strong>Indebtedness Ratio - </strong>This value specifies the range within which a client's indebtedness rate can fall (Formula for calculation of indebtedness rate is explained in the following section). Mifos allows loans to be created only if the calculated Indebtedness Rate for a client is lesser than this pre-specified value.  This value is expressed as a percentage and can be between 0 and 50%.</p>
<p><strong>Repayment Capacity - </strong> This value specifies the range within which a client's repayment capacity can fall (Formula for calculation of repayment capacity is explained in the following section).  Mifos allows loans to be created only if the calculated Repayment Capacity for a client is is between the pre-specified range.  This value is expressed as a percentage and can be between 150 and 1000%.</p>

<h2><span class="Apple-style-span">How to create a new loan account with variable installments</span></h2>
<p>As discussed in the previous section,  variable installment loans can be created with or without the compare with cash flow option. We first look at the process of creating a variable installment loan without cash flow comparison enabled.</p>
<p>Before creating a loan with variable installment, ensure that the required loan product has variable installment option enabled. If variable installment has already been enabled for the loan product, please skip the following steps and move to the next section 'Creating New Loan'.</p>
<p>If a <em>new</em> loan product with variable installment has to be created, follow the steps mentioned in the previous section to create new loan product with variable installments.</p>
<p>To have variable installment configured for an <em>existing</em> loan product, follow these steps:</p>
<p>1. Click <strong>Admin&gt;Manage Loan Products&gt;View Loan Products</strong>. A list of existing loan products is displayed.</p>
<h1><img src="static/view%20loan%20products_1.png" /><br />
</h1>
<p> </p>
<p> 2. Select the loan product which needs to be modified by clicking on it. The loan product's details are displayed as shown in the screenshot below.</p>
<h1><img src="static/Variable%20Instal%20-%20View%20Loan%20Product.png" /><br />
</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>3. Click 'Edit Loan Product Information' on the top right of the page. The loan product details page appears in Edit mode. Scroll down to section 'Repayment Schedule'.</p>
<p>4.  Check the 'Can configure variable installments' checkbox and fill in the installment details as explained in the previous section.</p>
<p><img src="static/configure%20variable%20installments.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Grace period in variable installments:</strong> To specify grace period for variable installment loans, the grace period should first be set at the product level. While creating the loan product, under section Repayment Schedule, fill in the grace period details as explained in the How to Define and Change New and Existing Loan Products section. This is how grace period is implemented in the case of variable installment loans: </p>

<h2><span class="Apple-style-span">Creating New Loan Account with Variable Installments and Cash Flow Comparison configured</span></h2>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> Cash Flow comparison feature enables MFIs to first assess if their clients have enough money to repay loans. This assessment is done by comparing the client's overall cash flow with his/ her monthly installment.  </p>
<p><strong>Creating a new Loan account: </strong>Before proceeding with creating a new loan account with cash flow comparison, ensure that the specific loan product has cash flow comparison feature enabled. To enable this, refer to section &quot;Cash flow comparison settings&quot;.</p>
<p>Once the cash flow comparison settings have been enabled at the loan product level, follow these steps to create a new loan account with variable installments.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">The process of creating a new loan account with cash flow comparison is similar to what has been outlined in the previous section (&quot;Create a new loan account with variable installments&quot;).  For clarity, the steps are stated again with the new inclusion, cash flow comparison.

<p>All the months which fall between the first and the last installments, including the first and the last installment months are displayed. In addition, the month immediately preceding the first installment month and the month immediately following the last installment are displayed. </p>
<p>Example 1: Disbursal date: 26-Aug-2010, No. of Installments: 3, Frequency of Loan Installments: 1 month</p>
<p>Installment Months: September, October and November.</p>
<p>Cash flow months will be captured for months : August, September, October, November, December. </p>
<p>Example 2: Disbursal date: 26-Aug-2010, No. of Installments: 8, Frequency of Loan Installments: 2 Weeks</p>
<p>Installment Months: September, October, November and December.</p>
<p>Cash flow months will be captured for months : August, September, October, November, December, January. </p>
<p><strong>Cash Flow Data</strong> </p>
<p>Enter the client's expense and revenue for each of the listed months, in the fields &quot;Expense&quot; and &quot;Revenue&quot; respectively. In the notes column, enter any comment/ note about the client's revenue/ expense for that particular month. Also enter the client's Total Capital and Total Liability<strong>.</strong> Click <strong>Continue</strong>. The client's cash flow is calculated, as explained below.</p>
<p><strong>Cash Flow Comparison calculation</strong> </p>
<p>In general, cash flow is captured starting one month before the first installment month to allow the MFI to enter cash in hand thus far leading into the installment month. On the disbursal month, the loan amount is added to the the cumulative cash flow for comparison.</p>
<p>The month immediately following the last installment month is added to allow the MFI to see what sort of an impact loan payment will have on the customer. If there is a sudden drop of cash of the customer into the month right after the loan payment, then it may lead to a situation where the customer may default. Thus, to better understand the customer's position after repayment of loan, MFIs capture the cash flow for the following month as well. </p>
<p>After the revenue and expenses for each month are entered and you click <strong>Continue, </strong>the system calculates the indebtedness rate and repayment capacity of the client with the information provided in the cash flow capture page. If the client's indebtedness rate is greater than the allowed value specified during creation of the loan product or if the client's repayment capacity is less than the threshold value specified during creation of the loan product, the loan account cannot be created.</p>
<p><strong>Formula for calculation of Indebtedness Rate:</strong>  </p>
<p>Indebtedness Rate= (Total liability + loan amount)*100/Total capital</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>During loan product definition, the indebtedness rate has been set as 100. </p>
<p>Assume a Rs.1000 loan is being applied for. </p>
<p>Total liability = Rs.5000, Total capital = Rs.4000 (entered by the user)</p>
<p>Indebtedness rate = (5000 + 1000)*100/4000 = 150. </p>
<p>The client's indebtedness rate is greater than the permissible limit, hence Mifos will not allow the loan to be created. An error message will be displayed as follows.</p>
<p><img src="static/cash%20compare%20-%20error.png" /> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Formula for Calculation of Repayment Capacity:</strong></p>
<p>Repayment Capacity=[(Total revenues-Total expenses)+Loan Amount]*100 / Sum of Installments amount</p>
<p>Example: </p>
<p>During loan product definition, the Repayment Capacity limit has been set as 150. </p>
<p>Assume a Rs.1000 loan is being applied for. </p>
<p>Assume sum of all expenses entered by the user on the cash flow page is Rs.5000 and the sum of all revenues entered is 10000. Assume the sum of all installment amounts is 1500.</p>
<p>Repayment Capacity = [(10000 - 5000) + 1000] * 100/ 1500 = 400.</p>
<p>The Repayment Capacity of 400 is over the required minimum capacity of 150. Thus, Mifos allows the loan to be created. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>8.  After the cash flow details have been entered and the system allows the loan to be created, the Review Installments page is displayed. The page contains details of the installments and a summary of the cash flow. A screen similar to this will be displayed.</p>
<h1><img src="static/variable%20instal%20-%20installments.png" /><br />
</h1>
<p>Please refer to the previous section &quot;Creating new loan with variable installments&quot; for details on how to edit the installment dates and total installment amount.<img src="static/variable%20isntal%20-%20cash%20flow%20summary.png" /></p>
<p>The Cash Flow summary table displays the following fields:</p>
<p><strong>Months </strong>- Name of the installment month</p>
<p><strong>Cumulative Cash Flow</strong> - This is calculated as: <span class="Apple-style-span">Cash flow for present installment + Sum of cash flows for all previous installments</span></p>
<p><strong>Cumulative Cash Flow - Total Installment Amount per month - </strong>This value is the difference between the cumulative cash flow for a particular installment month and the total installment amount for that month.</p>
<p><strong>Total installment amount per month as % of cash flow - </strong>If this value exceeds the warning threshold specified at the time of loan product creation, then Mifos will not allow the loan to be created.</p>
<p> <strong>Notes</strong> - Any notes recorded in the system for that particular installment month.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>9. To proceed with the loan creation, click <strong>Validate. </strong>This will validate the edited installment data against the conditions specified at the time of loan product creation. (please refer previous section on &quot;Creating new loan with variable installments&quot; for the various validations performed and possible errors). </p>
<p>10. Click <strong>Preview </strong> to click the loan account information.  A screen similar to this will be displayed. </p>

<h1>Introduction to savings accounts</h1>
<h2><span id="ch052_introduction-to-savings-accounts.xhtml#what-is-a-savings-account">What is a savings account?</span></h2>
<p>You can create savings accounts for centers, groups, and clients based on the savings products defined in Mifos. All accounts inherit the rules of the product they are created from.</p>
<p>Note: The savings product must be in an Active state before you can create an account based on it.</p>
<p>Savings accounts are vital to the economic health of the client or group. MFIs encourage regular contributions to these accounts, and in some cases make contributions mandatory. Your MFI could make a rule that you cannot create loan accounts for borrowers unless their savings accounts are at a minimum level. You may also make a rule that the client or group does not earn interest if the savings account is lower than a specified minimum amount.</p>
<p>If you create a savings account for a group or a center, all members of the group or center can deposit to and withdraw from these accounts. Usually, when a transaction is made, the user chooses the client name from a list of approved clients belonging to that group or centre.</p>
<p>A center, group, or client can have more than one account, of the same or different savings products, but a single account cannot be shared by more than one center, group, or client. In addition, no conversion is allowed between individual client accounts and center/group accounts.</p>
<h2><span id="ch052_introduction-to-savings-accounts.xhtml#mandatory-versus-voluntary-savings">Mandatory versus voluntary savings</span></h2>
<p>Some MFIs make their savings accounts mandatory. The minimum deposit amount is considered &quot;due&quot; at every meeting day of the account owner.  Partial payments are allowed. If the client or group does not make this minimum deposit on time, the required deposit amount at the next meeting is increased by that amount. For example, if the minimum deposit is 50, and the client does not pay, then at the next meeting, the required deposit will be 100. If the minimum deposit is 50 and the client pays 25, then at the next meeting, the required deposit will be 75.</p>
<p>If the savings account is held by a center, the deposit amount is applied to all clients in Active or On Hold states. If the savings account is held by a group, and the minimum deposit applies to each group member separately, the deposit amount is applied to clients in Active or On Hold states.</p>
<p>Voluntary accounts have no minimum deposit, though there is a &quot;recommended deposit&quot; amount that can be included in the definition of the savings product.</p>
<h2><span id="ch052_introduction-to-savings-accounts.xhtml#the-savings-account-dashboard">The savings account &quot;dashboard&quot;</span></h2>
<p>The savings account details page (&quot;dashboard&quot;) shows the detailed transactions and functions related to savings accounts. It includes the account status, the recent activity status, and transaction tracking details.</p>
<p>To view the dashboard, in any Search box, type the account number for the savings account. You can also type the client or group name and click the account link from the details page for that client or group.</p>

<h1>How to create a new savings account</h1>
<p>The following are necessary for you to create a savings account:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the savings account is for a client or group, the client and/or group must be in Approved state.</li>
<li>If the savings account is for a center, the center must be Active.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: You may not delete savings accounts.</p>
<p>You can create a new account from several places in Mifos.  One way is to navigate to the details page for that client, group, or center.  You can do this by searching for the client, group, or center from the Search on the Home screen or navigating to the details page directly<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>From the Home screen search function<br />
<img src="static/Mifos-mifoshomesearch-en.png" title="mifoshomesearch" alt="mifoshomesearch" width="408" height="210" /> </li>
</ul>

<h1>How to import M-PESA transactions</h1>
<p>M-PESA is a mobile-phone based money transfer service designed to enable users to complete basic banking transactions without the need to visit a bank branch. This form of a branchless banking service would allow borrowers to conveniently receive and repay loans through mobile phones. This would enable microfinance institutions (MFIs) to offer more competitive loan rates to their users, as there is a reduced cost of dealing in cash. The users of the service would gain through being able to track their finances more easily.   </p>
<h2><strong>Overview of the M-PESA import plug-in</strong></h2>
<p><strong></strong>The M-PESA import plug-in is the basis for mobile money integration with Mifos. This plugin integrates with Kenya's leading mobile money platform by supporting the import of an Excel (.xls) spreadsheet into Mifos. MFIs accepting transactions via M-PESA currently download a spreadsheet with a record of each transaction from Safaricom. Safaricom is a mobile network operator in Kenya.</p>
<p><strong>What the plug-in does</strong> </p>
<p>This plugin allows for the import and validation of these transactions via the mobile phone number of the customer.  Currently the plugin supports the import of loan repayments and savings deposits into Mifos. Incoming payments are first applied towards the current amount due on any applicable loans and the remaining amount is then deposited to a savings account.  </p>
<h2>Install and Configure Plug-in</h2>
<p>To install and configure the plug-in, refer to the documentation available <a href="http://mifosforge.jira.com/wiki/display/MIFOS/Plugin+Management">here</a>. </p>
<p>The M-PESA mode of loan repayment should also be added to the mifos system - as lookup option and payment type.</p>
<p><strong>Add MPESA as Lookup Option</strong> </p>
<p>1. Click <strong>Admin&gt; Define Lookup Options.</strong> </p>
<p>2. Under category <strong>Payment Modes</strong>, add MPESA. To add this option, click the edit option next to Payment Modes. A textbox to add a new payment mode is displayed. Add MPESA and click Submit. *IMPORTANT: This must be MPESA, not M-PESA or any other variant. </p>
<p><img src="static/mpesa%20-add%20mpesa.png" /> </p>
<p> 3. After clicking Submit, check and ensure that MPESA has been added to the list displayed under payment modes.</p>
<p><img src="static/mpesa%20-%20check.png" /> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> <strong>Add M-PESA as Payment Type</strong></p>
<p>Before adding M-PESA as an accepted payment type, make sure that it has already been added as a Lookup Option. </p>
<p> 1. Click <strong>Admin&gt;Define Accepted Payment Types.</strong> The following categories and fields will be displayed.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Clients/ Groups/ Centers
</li>
<ul>
<li>Fees</li>
</ul>
<li>
Loans
</li>
<ul>
<li>Disbursements</li>
<li>Repayments</li>
</ul>
<li>
Savings
</li>
<ul>
<li>Withdrawals</li>
<li>Deposits </li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>  <img src="static/mpesa%20-payment%20types.png" /> </p>
<p>2. Since M-PESA has already been added as a lookup option, it will be displayed on the left box under each category. Add M-PESA as an accepted payment type. To do this, click on M-PESA on the left box to select. Then click Add. </p>
<p><img src="static/mpesa%20-%20add%20payment%20type.png" /> </p>
<p>3. Click Submit.</p>
<p>Take note of the following points while configuring the plug-in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the M-PESA plugin has been installed in the proper directory. The plugin (a jar file) has to be copied into $MIFOS_CONF/plugins folder (detailed in the install instructions available <a href="http://mifosforge.jira.com/wiki/display/MIFOS/Plugin+Management#PluginManagement-Install">here</a>).</li>
<li>The file generated by Safaricom cannot be used as in by Mifos. Only Excel formats will be accepted by the system. To convert the Safaricom file to Excel, open the file in Excel and save it with .xls extension.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<div>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">How to define order to apply transactions</span></p>
</div>
<p>In the properties file called <em>ke.co.safaricom.MPesaXlsImporter.ImportTransactionOrder</em> specify the default order of transactions. This can be done by specifying all required product names separated by comma (,). Accounts to which repayments and deposits are made will be applied to in the order specified here when importing a row.</p>
<p>While specifying the order of transactions, make sure that there is only one savings account at the end. </p>
<p>If the default order of transactions is not specified in the properties file, you will have to manually specify which the short name of the loan product in which to apply payments to in the <em>Transaction Party Details</em> column in the spreadsheet being imported.</p>
<p>Otherwise, during import you will receive an error noting &quot;Missing required data&quot;. </p>
<p>You can confirm whether or not the order to apply transactions has been defined by going to <strong>Admin - View organization settings.</strong> Underneath the miscellaneous heading, you should see <em>MPESA transaction order</em> and a status of DEFINED or NOT DEFINED.</p>
<h2>How to import M-PESA transaction file</h2>
<p>To import the M-PESA transaction file into Mifos, click <strong>Admin&gt;Manage Imports&gt; Import Transactions</strong>. From the Import format dropdown box, select M-PESA and then choose the Excel file from Safaricom which needs to be imported into the Mifos system. </p>
<p> <img src="static/import%20transactions.png" /> </p>
<p> Following are the columns in the imported m-PESA file.</p>
<p><strong>Receipt (required) -</strong> Receipt ID is proof of payment and a unique MPESA identifier that can be cross-referenced with clients phone receipt. This must be imported into Mifos since needed as reference in the Collection Sheet.</p>
<p><strong>Date (required) - </strong>Payment Date. The payment date cannot be before the present date. However, if  backdated transactions have been enabled in Mifos, then the date can be before the present date up until the previous meeting date.  </p>
<p><strong>Details - </strong>Contains information payment received from phone number, telephone number, MFI account number. The value of this column is ignored.</p>
<p><strong>Status (required) - </strong>One of four statuses displayed - Completed, Attempted, Cancelled, Declined. This value must be Completed or else it is ignored.</p>
<p><strong>Withdrawn -</strong> Amount paid from MFI. This is the amount of the payment out from the MFI in the form of a disbursal.</p>
<p><strong>Paid In -</strong><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Transaction amount paid to MFI. This is the amount of the repayment/deposit from the customer to the MFI. </p>
<p><strong>Balance - </strong>Balance of MFI. This value is ignored during import. </p>
<p><strong>Balance confirmed - </strong>This value is ignored during import. </p>
<p><strong>Transaction Type (required) -</strong> This field determines if this is a repayment or disbursal. For the M-PESA plug-in support repayments and disbursals, if this value is &quot;Pay Utility&quot; it will be treated as a repayment and there must be a corresponding value in the Paid In column. If the value is &quot;Business Payment&quot;, it will be treated as a disbursal and there must be a corresponding value in the Withdrawn column. For prior versions of the plug-in that only supported repayments, all values other than &quot;Pay Utility&quot; will be ignored. </p>
<p><strong>Other Party Info (required) -</strong> This field is required and is Safaricom generated phone number and is the phone number that is used to cross-reference the Safaricom M-PESA account with the account in Mifos. The 10 digit number in this column is compared against the Phone Number field under the Client record in Mifos.</p>
<p><strong>Transaction Party Details -</strong><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>This field will include Mifos Product Code if there is one, and other information such as Client's Group ID, etc. A value is required here if no default order to apply transactions has been defined in the .properties configuration file.  If the Mifos Product Code is different than the default order set in <a href="http://ke.co.safaricom.MPesaXlsImporter.ImportTransactionOrder">ke.co.safaricom.MPesaXlsImporter.ImportTransactionOrder,</a> then this field will include the short names of product(s) applied to the client's accounts.</p>
<p><strong>Logic behind payment application</strong> </p>
<p>If there is a product name specified after a client ID,  then payment is applied to that particular product. If no product name is specified, then all  transaction amounts will be applied according to the default order which was specified initially. </p>
<p> For example: Lets assume ke.co.safaricom.MPesaXlsImporter.ImportTransactionOrder  =      AL1, NL1,SP1 where AL1, NL1 and SP1 are product names. In this case, all rows that do      not specify a product name after the client ID will have their transaction amount applied to in this order. Only the next payment due will  be applied.  In this example, if the client owes  $10 on AL1 next instalment and $20 on NL1, and the client pays $100 then those    respective amounts would be applied, and then $70 deposited in SP1.</p>
<p><strong>Repayments versus Disbursals </strong></p>
<p>Repayments and Deposits will have the Transaction type of Pay Utility and a corresponding value in the Paid In column. Disbursals will have the Transaction Type of Business Payment and a corresponding value in the Withdrawn column.</p>
<h2>How to cancel or correct errors during import</h2>
<p>If there are errors during import, Mifos displays an appropriate error message. The  screenshot below shows the error message displayed when the file is uploaded with no valid rows. </p>
<p> <img src="static/mifos_error%20message.png" /> </p>
<p>The screenshot below shows the error messages displayed when rows with import data are found and they are not properly validated. You'll notice that the total amount of transactions to be imported is listed as 0.0 because all transactions have errors. When the total amount to be imported is 0.0, you will not be allowed to submit. See below for a list of common errors and steps to resolve them. </p>
<p> <img src="static/MPESA_error.jpg" /></p>
<p>  To correct the error, click the button <strong>Edit Import Information</strong>.This will direct the user back to the main page displayed below and the corrected file can be uploaded again.</p>
<p>  <img src="/mifos-user-manual/edit/static/import%20transactions.png" /></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>How to verify that data has been imported </h2>
<p>If there are rows that contain no errors and will successfully be imported, you will see a screen like below with the number of rows that will be imported and a summation of the total transactions to be imported.</p>
<p> <img src="/mifos-user-manual/edit/static/m-pesa_success.jpg" /></p>
<p>After uploading the Excel file and clicking Submit, Mifos imports the file and displays a confirmation screen that the import was successful.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p> &lt;&lt;screenshot with confirmation message&gt;&gt;</p>
<p> Once the file has been imported, there is no option to revert the file upload.</p>
<h2>Common error messages while importing</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">Row &lt;22&gt; error - Y88CM251 - Missing required data</span></p>
<p>This error message typically occurs when the order to apply transactions has not been defined. To resolve, either define the default order for payment transactions in your .properties configuration file or manually specify the short code of the product the transaction should apply to in the Transaction Party Details column of your import spreadsheet.  </p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">Row &lt;18&gt; error - Y89QA171 - Invalid transaction date </span></p>
<p>This error message typically occurs if you have the transaction date does not fall in the correct range. Transaction date cannot be prior to previous meeting or later than today (i.e. if last meeting date was Feb 18 and today is Feb 24, transaction date must be between Feb 18 and Feb 24.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">Row &lt;#&gt; error - &lt;Receipt ID&gt; - Transactions with same Receipt ID have already been imported.</span> </p>
<p>This error message is displayed if a transaction with that Receipt ID has already been imported and exists in Mifos. This is to prevent duplicate transactions from being imported.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">Row &lt;#&gt; error - &lt;Receipt ID&gt; - Date does not begin with expected format (YYYY-MM-DD). </span> </p>
<p>This error message is displayed if the date is not in the proper format of YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:ss</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">Row &lt;#&gt; error - &lt;Receipt ID&gt; - Client with mobile number &lt;mobile number&gt; was not found.</span></p>
<p>This error message if the mobile number specified in the Other Party Info column of the import spreadsheet does not belong to a client in Mifos.  This is the primary way in which Mifos references an M-PESA transaction.  The first 10 digits in the Other Party Info column are recognized as a phone number and compared with the Client's Phone Number field in Mifos. If there is not a match, the message is displayed.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">Row &lt;#&gt; error - &lt;Receipt ID&gt; - More than 1 client with mobile number &lt;mobile number&gt; was found.</span></p>
<p>Likewise, M-PESA accounts must be unique and transactions can only be applied to one customer account; if the phone number matches more than one Phone Number in Mifos, this error message will be displayed.  </p>

<h2>Accessing Mifos Business Intelligence Suite Reports</h2>
<p>Once Mifos Business Intelligence is installed, follow these instructions to select and run reports:</p>
<ul>
<li>Log in to your instance of Mifos Business Intelligence Suite in your internet browser.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<img src="static/2_mifos-bi_login.jpg" />
</div>
<ul>
<li>Switch to the Browser View to access a folder hierarchy listing of reports (this will not displayed the first time you log in). </li>
</ul>
<div>
<p><img src="static/3_mifos-bi_browser.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Select the <strong>Standard Reports</strong> folder and list of the available standard reports will be displayed. </li>
</ul>
<div>
<img src="/mifos-user-manual/edit/static/4_mifos-bi_folder.jpg" />
</div>
<ul>
<li>Double-click the title of a report and new tab will open in the Pentaho window.  You are able to load and view multiple reports at once.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Selecting Values for Parameters of Each Report</h2>
<p>Each report has a different number of parameters which can be selected to filter the data displayed in the report.  These filters and parameters were created when building the original report and can only be customized through the Pentaho Report Designer. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Filters:</strong> these parameters correspond to different fields in Mifos. Some drop-downs will be dynamically populated based on the chosen value for the previous drop-down.</p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>To not filter the data based on a parameter, leave the value set as <strong>ALL</strong> or <strong>Any</strong>. </li>
<li>Note: if your data set is large, for some reports when you leave the parameter at <strong>ALL</strong> or <strong>Any</strong>, the report will take a while to generate because of the large amount of data. </li>
</ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Dates:</strong> Date values can be entered freehand or selected via the Calendar picker. </p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>For reports that provide a snapshot overview of data at a point-in-time, you can select a date via the <strong>As On Date</strong> field.</li>
<li>For reports that compare or show data over a range of time, you select the date range via fields stating <strong>Start Date</strong> and <strong>End Date</strong> or in some cases <strong>From Date</strong> and <strong>To Date</strong></li>
</ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Output Type:</strong> Reports can be generated in three formats - PDF, Excel, or HTML.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div>
<img src="static/5_mifos-bi_output.type.jpg" />
</div>
<p>We will go through several reports to show an example of creating a report in each of the different formats. </p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">Generating a Report in PDF format</span></p>
<p>PDF format is good when you simply need to view the data of the report or share it with an external audience and do no further data manipulation.</p>
<p>This example will show how to generate a PDF of the <em>Balance Outstanding by Source of Funds</em> report<em>, </em>showing<span class="Apple-style-span"> balance outstanding and other figures per source of funds in Mifos.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Double-click the <strong>Balance Outstanding by Source of Funds</strong> from lefthand folder repository.</li>
<li>For <strong>Office</strong>, select which office to run the report for, I've chosen <strong>office-2.</strong></li>
<li>For <strong>Source of Funds,</strong> select which Source of Funds to sort the report by. In this example, I've left it all.</li>
<li>Choose date in  <strong>As On Date</strong>. I've left it as today - 2011-05-09. </li>
<li>For <strong>Output Type,</strong> select <strong>PDF</strong>. <img src="static/5_mifos-bi_pdf.jpg" /></li>
<li>Click <strong>Run Report.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>PDF will be generated in the same tab. Pressing <strong>Clear Report</strong> will clear out the report and allow you to generate it once more with different parameters in the same tab.</p>
<p>*Note: When attempting to save the report, some browsers like Chrome might not display the full Adobe Reader toolbar and you may need to right-click the report itself to bring up the &quot;Save As&quot; option. </p>
<div>
<h2>Generating a Report in Excel format</h2>
<p>Running a report in Excel format is good for sets of data that you need to sort, manipulate, or analyze further.  </p>
<p>This example will show to how generate an Excel spreadsheet of the <em>Mifos Transactions - Detail</em> Report, a<span class="Apple-style-span"> report can be run at the end of day to display all transactions made in Mifos that day.  This report shows each detailed transaction.  This report is useful for reconciliation with accounting and a good example of a report to be generated in Excel.</span> </p>
<p>This report displays every transaction in Mifos; if a small date range or applicable filters or not selected, it can be a very lengthy report. </p>
<ol>
<li>Double-click  <strong>Mifos Transactions - Detail</strong> from lefthand folder repository.</li>
<li>Select a date range to display the transactions. I will select a small time frame, choosing 2010-03-02 for the <strong>From Date</strong> and 2010-03-05 for the <strong>To Date</strong>.</li>
<li>For <strong>Branch Office</strong>, I selected <strong>office-2.</strong> </li>
<li>Based on my Branch Office selection, the <strong>Personnel</strong> field will be populated with staff from office-2. I chose <strong>user-10</strong> for this example.</li>
<li>For <strong>Transaction Type</strong>, I can select a single value for any type of transaction processed by Mifos or I can leave it <strong>ALL</strong>. For this example, I selected <strong>ALL</strong>.<img src="static/7_mifos-bi_xls_trans_type.jpg" /></li>
<li>For <strong>Mode of Payment</strong>, I can choose from Cash, Cheque, Voucher (whatever the payment types are that you've configured in Mifos). I selected <strong>Cash. </strong></li>
<li>Choose <strong>EXCEL</strong> for <strong>Output Type</strong>.<img src="static/8_mifos-bi_xls_run.jpg" /></li>
<li>Click <strong>Run Report.</strong></li>
</ol>
Depending on your internet browser, your Excel file will be generated and downloaded locally to your machine.  
<h2>Generating a Report in HTML format</h2>
<p>Running a report in HTML format is good for viewing or embedding the report in another web page or web application.</p>
<p>This example will show how to generate an HTML version of the <em>MFI Progress</em> report which<span class="Apple-style-span"> shows a comparison of 2 months specified by the user of the MFI's metrics, arrears, loan balances, etc.   This report is useful in providing information on progress at the MFI - for example, if they are expanding their outreach at a certain pace, or if their PAR has increased or decreased.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Double-click <strong>MFI Progress</strong> from lefthand folder repository.</li>
<li>For <strong>Office</strong>, I selected <strong>office-2.</strong></li>
<li>Select two months for comparison. For <strong>Month 1</strong>, I chose <strong>Mar 2011.</strong> For <strong>Month 2</strong>, I chose <strong>April 2011</strong>.</li>
<li>Choose <strong> HTML </strong>for <strong>Output Type</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Run Report.</strong></li>
</ol>
Report will be generated in the same tab. You can right click to open it in a new tab or frame and then can click right click to save the page as an HTML file.

<p>Mifos ships with a large set of standard reports. The majority of these are written in Pentaho and part of the Mifos Business Intelligence Suite.  A limited number (which are being phased out) are written in BIRT and directly embedded in the Mifos User Interface. This section applies to those.</p>
<p>Accessing and using these reports does not require that you install BIRT (Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools, a free, open-source application from Eclipse). However, if you want to customize the reports, you must <a href="http://www.mifos.org/developers/wiki/ReportingInMifos#installing-birt" title="Installing BIRT">install BIRT</a>. You can also create your own reports using BIRT.</p>
<p>The three reports are as follows:<br />

<h1>Introduction to Question Groups</h1>
<p>Question Groups provide a means for collecting information about a user or a group that can then be used, for example, when assessing loan applications, poverty levels, and for measuring impact and creating exit and collateral surveys.  <span>MFIs</span> create a common set of  questions. Users can then choose from these questions when defining new question groups. Question Groups can be attached to entities or workflows.  The same question group can be attached multiple times to the same entity to track historical changes over time.  Question Groups replace both <strong>Additional Field</strong> and <strong>Survey</strong> functionality in Mifos 1.6.x and lower.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Smart Select</strong> - This answer type can be used for questions that have categories and for which the client should see the answer choices and their respective tags when entering answers. For example, the user may want to ask a client what his or her business activity is, and have categories of business activity. Answer choices could be entered as Cow Purchase, Pig Purchase, etc. A tag can be added to these answer choices as &quot;Animal Husbandry.&quot; Then, when the Loan Officer is entering the answer for this client's business activity, Animal Husbandry can be entered to see the detailed choices.</p>

<h1>Progress out of Poverty Index</h1>
<h2>Introduction to the PPI</h2>
<p>The Progress out of Poverty Index (PPI) Survey is a country-specific question group that is used to determine the likelihood of a client belonging to a specific poverty level. A MFI uses this information on a portfolio level to calculate overall poverty rates. At the client level, the information is used to determine which products to offer a client or to track loan repayments/retention/recruitment rates of clients falling into each of the poverty buckets.</p>
<p>The surveys for each country include 10 questions. For each question, points are associated with each possible answer. The total number of points for a completed survey is called the poverty index score. For each country, a poverty likelihood chart is defined that maps the poverty index score to a percentage that indicates the percentage likelihoods of poverty for the client.</p>

<h1>How to attach a question group</h1>
<p>One of the definitive features of Question Groups is that they can be attached at any stage of the workflow in Mifos. Previously you could only attach surveys to different records with no control over the workflow stage they get displayed at.</p>
<p>In this section, we demonstrate the previously-existing capability to attach question groups to various records. In the next section, we'll demonstrate attaching to stages of the workflow (i.e. Create, Approve, View)  </p>

<h1>Rules for how to reschedule repayment</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If the client did not make the payment for an installment:</p>
</li>
<ol type="a">
<li>For flat-interest loans, in next installment, &quot;Penalty + Payment1 + Payment2&quot;</li>
<li>For declining-balance loans, the next installment will be recalculated to include the missed installment. (There is no concept of payment 1 and payment 2 in this case.)</li>
</ol>
<li>
<p>If the repayment day falls on a holiday and repayment is set to the next repayment, the client must pay two installments on the next repayment day. No penalty will be calculated for that period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A penalty for failing to pay an installment is calculated only for the affected installment period.  The same approach is applied to subsequent installments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The grace period can be modified:</p>
</li>
<ol type="a">
<li>For a loan account whose grace period has not ended.</li>
<li>Only for future installments if the grace period has ended.</li>
</ol>
<li>
<p>If client does not have any meeting date, then repayment start date is the actual disbursement date + repayment frequency + grace period.</p>

<h1>How to calculate the EMI<br />
</h1>
<p>EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) is the amount payable to the lending institution every month, till the loan is paid back in full. It consists of a portion of the interest as well as the principal.  This is what is due at each installment of a loan.</p>

<td><p>Definition</p></td>
<td><p>Interest is computed at periodic intervals on the amount of the original principal that has not yet been repaid. Since the borrower only pays interest on that amount of original principal that has not yet been repaid, interest paid will be smaller every period.</p></td>
<td><p>The exception from the EMI computed in the first column is that interest is calculated using equal principal installments. The client pays equal installments of principal for the duration of the loan, and the interest is calculated on principal that has not been paid for the loan period.</p></td>

<p>The way to apply payments is as follows:</p>
<p>Calculate interest in the principal due: If balance = $1000, and i = 0.025, interest is $25</p>
<p>Calculate the amount to principal which is the monthly payment minus the interest due: $518.83 - $25 = $493.83</p>
<p>Calculate the principal remaining, which is the previous principal remaining minus the amount applied to principal: $1000 - $493.83 = $506.17 (remaining balance)</p>
<p>Once next payment is received, repeat steps 1 to 3.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Due to rounding of computed values, it could potentially be off by a maximum of N number of pennies after the full term of the loan. It will never be short if we round up, rather, principal could end up with a few more pennies.</p></td>

<p>Principal = 15,000/25 = 600</p>
<p>For Installment 1:<br />
</p>
<p>Total due = Principal + Interest = 600 + 143.83 = 743.83</p>
<p>For Installment 2:</p>
<p>Interest = (15000-600)*.25*14/365 = 140</p>
<p>Total due = 600 + 140 = 740</p>

<h1>Tips and techniques</h1>
<h2>Printing reports with a dot-matrix printer</h2>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>BIRT reports do not print out clearly on a dot matrix printer.</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>Use the Arial font or another sans-serif font. These fonts print better on dot matrix printers, which have lower print resolution than inkjet or laser printers.</p>
<h2>Calculating flat interest rates</h2>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>You may have a loan product with a flat interest rate, but Mifos requires you to enter the interest rates as APR.</p>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>Use the following formula. It will calculate the value you need to enter for the loan repayment schedule.</p>
<h3>Formula</h3>
<p>To calculate the yearly APR, use the following formula:</p>
<pre><code>APR = (Interest Amount * Period of Calculation [360 or 365]) / (Principal * Number of Weeks * 7)    </code></pre>
<p>Here is an example, using the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calculation period = 365 days</li>
<li>Interest amount = 40%</li>
<li>Principal = $200</li>
<li>Number of weeks = 24</li>
</ul>

<h2><span id="ch083_credits.xhtml#General%20Public%20License"></span> General Public License</h2>
<p>Version 2, June 1991</p>
<p>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br />
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA<br />
<br />
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br />
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Preamble</strong></p>
<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.</p>
<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</p>
<p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</p>
<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>
<p>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.</p>
<p>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.</p>
<p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</p>
<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.</p>
<p><strong>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</strong></p>
<p><strong>0.</strong> This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot; means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</p>
<p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>
<p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<p><br />
</p>
</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>a)</strong> You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<p><br />
</p>
</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>b)</strong> You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<p><br />
</p>
</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>c)</strong> If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p>
<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.</p>
<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<p><br />
</p>
</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>a)</strong> Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<p><br />
</p>
</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>b)</strong> Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<p><br />
</p>
</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>c)</strong> Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.</p>
<p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</p>
<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</p>
<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.</p>
<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong> The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>10.</strong> If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</p>
<p><strong>NO WARRANTY</strong></p>
<p><strong>11.</strong> BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>
<p><strong>12.</strong> IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
